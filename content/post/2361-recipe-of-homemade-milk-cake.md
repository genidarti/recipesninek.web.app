Hot milk cake is made with scalded milk and plenty of eggs. It has a soft but dense vanilla crumb and is topped off with the most addictive chocolate fudge frosting you&#39;ve ever tried (seriously!). Milk and sugar are cooked and then split with alum, cooled, set and cut into cubes. The slight caramelisation gives it a light brown colour and slightly fudgy texture - addictive! Even I mistook the name for some cake when I first saw this at Nishamadhulika.
