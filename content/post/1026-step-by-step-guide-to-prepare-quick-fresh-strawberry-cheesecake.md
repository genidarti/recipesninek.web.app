recipeinstructions:
- "Line a 20-23cm springform cake tin with greaseproof paper."

- "Put the cream mixture into the tin and smooth it evenly until it covers all the strawberries that you&#39;ve put around the tin."
- "Get the remaining strawberries and slice them thinly. Place them over the top of the cheesecake, it doesn&#39;t matter if they overlap."
- "Put the cheesecake in the fridge for at least 8 hours, preferably over night. Then serve."
