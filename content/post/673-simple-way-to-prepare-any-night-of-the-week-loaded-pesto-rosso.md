- "To preserve in the fridge Transfer your pesto in a tall jar, and level out its surface. Then completely cover the pesto&#39;s surface with a layer of your best olive oil (this will prevent the pesto from oxidizing)."
- "To play with this recipe Increase the amount of basil (four times) and don&#39;t use olives or sun-dried tomatoes for a more classic green pesto. Add chives, ramps (!!), or fresh parsley for variations on herbaceous flavors. Substitute walnuts for cashews for a creamier buttery taste or almonds for a drier fresher take. Take out the fresh tomatoes and double or triple the amount of olive oil for a more traditional Italian version (too heavy on the vegetable fats for me, but deeeeelicious)."
