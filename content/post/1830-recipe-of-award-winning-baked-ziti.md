recipeingredient:
- "2 lbs penne pasta"
- "1 1/2 lbs ground beef"
- "24 oz tomato sauce"
- "4 1/2 cups ricotta cheese"
- "4 cups mozzarella cheese shredded"
- "1 cup parmesan cheese"
- "2 eggs"
- "4 tbsp parsley"
- "1 tbsp salt"
- "1 tsp black pepper"
- "1 tsp oregano"
- "1/4 cup halved pepperoni slices optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375 degrees"
- "Boil water. Add some salt (about 1 tbsp) to flavor the pasta as it cooks. Once it boils, add pasta and cook for 15 minutes. Once pasta is done cooking, mix in a bit of sauce to keep it from sticking."
- "Heat a pan at medium heat, add the beef and some water (maybe 2 cups or so). Brown the chopped meat. This will take about 10 minutes - you’ll know it’s done when the juice is clear."
- "Then drain it. Once the meat cools a bit, break it up into small pieces if it isn’t already."
- "Get a large foil roast pan and coat the bottom with about 1/4 cup of sauce."
- "In a large bowl, mix together the meat and all ingredients, except the cooked pasta. Leave a little bit of sauce to the side to drizzle over the top later."
- "After the meat, cheeses, eggs, and seasonings are mixed well, add the pasta and mix well again."
- "Put the ziti in the baking pan. Sprinkle some extra mozzarella and parmesan cheese (maybe 2 handfuls of each) over the top layer. Then drizzle the last of the sauce over top."
- "Cover the pan with foil and cook in the oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Then, take off the foil and cook for another 20 minutes or so."
