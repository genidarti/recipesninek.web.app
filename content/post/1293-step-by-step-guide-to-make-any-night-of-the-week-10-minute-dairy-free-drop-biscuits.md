recipeinstructions:
- "I sometimes have to avoid dairy in my diet and I always try to avoid making a batch of traditional biscuits on a busy work-week morning... Here&#39;s what I do instead.... Preheat oven to 400 degrees."
- "Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl, mix in oil... I avoid shortening to prevent the extra time of cutting it in, a quick stir and add enough water to pull the dough together. You can use milk if you want but water works just as well. The trick is to add just a little too much liquid for traditional biscuits, you want the extra liquid to prevent them from drying out in the oven."
- "These are drop biscuits, drop about 7 clumps of uniform size on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top."
- "Bake for 10 minutes, allow to cool for a couple minutes before serving."
