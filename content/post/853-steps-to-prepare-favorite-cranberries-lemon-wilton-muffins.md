recipeingredient:
- " Ingredient A"
- "230 gr unsalted butter"
- "110 ml water"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- " Ingredient B"
- "350 gr all purpose flour"
- "1 tsp vanilla essence"
- " Ingredient C"
- "300 gr granulated sugar"
- "8 gr baking powder"
- " Extra Ingredients"
- "4 large eggs"
- "1 tbs lemon zest"
- "50 gr dried cranberries"
- "1/2 lemon juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven into 200°C or 400°F."
- "Prepare ingredient A: Mix them all into one pan, boil them until the butter completely melt. Set aside."
- "Prepare ingredient B: Combine AP flour with vanilla essence (I used the powder kind) stir them a bit until combine inside the mixing bowl."
- "Pour gently the butter mixture into the mixing bowl while the mixer is in a low speed, after all butter going in, set the mixer into a medium high speed."
- "Feel the bowl, if it&#39;s warm, you could continue by adding eggs (mixer back to low speed) one at a time. Don&#39;t add the eggs if the mixing bowl is still hot, otherwise the eggs would be cooked by the heat."
- "Add sugar and baking powder into the batter of the mixture, mix it until just combine. Remember, don&#39;t over mix the batter."
- "Fold in using a spatula the extra ingredients such as lemon zest and lemon juice. Keep the Cranberries for the last sprinkle. (The batter would be liquidy, so if you get that kind of consistency, you are in the right path 😂😂😂)"
- "Divide your batter into the muffin cups, fill it until 3/4 cup full. And sprinkle it with the cranberries on top."
- "Bake it at 200°C or 400°F about 8 to 10 minutes, and switch your temperature to 180°C or 350°F for another 5 to 10 minutes baking time."
- "Give a toothpick test. If it comes out clean, it means your muffin completely done, if there is still a wet batter, continue baking around 5 to 10 more minutes."
- "Enjoy! 😁"
- "My first time muffin."
- "This is the current muffin texture without the muffin&#39;s liner."
- "This is the inside texture, moist, light, and spongy. Slightly like butter cake texture."
