I measure mashed banana in cups rather than by the number of bananas. Butter - banana bread or almost any bread goes well with oil due to their naturally dense consistency. Oil makes them fluffy and moist. I came up with this recipe as a way to use the fresh beets I get in my CSA box.

It tastes just like zucchini bread to me, but it&#39;s a pretty pink color because of the beets. Beeturia, pink pee after beet consumption, is totally harmless—you&#39;re just peeing out some of the pigment. But it can be used to remind us of an important fact. Another symptom from beets - Migraine City! Lasts the whole time from when they are eaten until they make their pretty in pink exit.
