- "Simmer mixture for about 10 minutes covered. Or, until onions are translucent. Stir regularly. Add small splashes of beef stock if you feel your onions and garlic are on the verge of burning."
- "Gently wipe your mushrooms with a damp towel. Chop your mushrooms, remove stems snd add to your pot."
- "Add beef stock until your cleaned mushrooms are fully submerged. Once simmering - add your 2nd packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix. Mix well."
- "Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes depending upon how firm you prefer your mushrooms - covered. Stir regularly. Add additional beef stock as needed. Here&#39;s what your gravy will look like after 30 minutes."

- "Bring your gravy up to a steady boil and add 1/2 of your corn starch slurry mixture. Mix well, constantly and fast. Allow gravy to simmer for a minute. You&#39;ll see your gravy begin to thicken. Decide how thick you&#39;d like it. Thicker? Add the other half of your slurry. If you accidently find it&#39;s too thick - no worries - just add a bit more beef stock and mix well."
- "Pour this delicious gravy over everything from mashed potatoes, bangers [meaning sausages] to the side of fries or, over a poutine with cheese curds. Noodles, rice, open faced meat sandwiches, steaks or hamburger steaks are fantastic pairings as well! This gravy pairs well with just about any entrée. We even been known to heat up bread and dip directly into it! Enjoy!"
