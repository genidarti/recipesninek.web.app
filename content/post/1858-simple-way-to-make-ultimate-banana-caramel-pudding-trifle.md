Simple easy to make with Bananas, Vanilla pudding, Dulce De Leche ( found in the Mexican food section ) and Pound Cake. I don&#39;t know how it happened, but I&#39;ve developed quite a fondness (and following) for my versions of Southern classics like fried chicken, biscuits, and even banana cream pie. This Banana Pudding Trifle is a delicious and easy banana pudding dessert that is loaded with fresh bananas, banana pudding, vanilla wafers and cool whip!
