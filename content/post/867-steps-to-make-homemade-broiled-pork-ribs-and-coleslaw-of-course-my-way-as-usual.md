To get the pork ribs to cook evenly, the rack needs to be uniform from end-to-end. This way, the ribs do not need to be flipped or turned during the cooking process. Generally, we could just place the ribs in the oven to cook and they would turn out great, but a quick pass under the broiler will crisp. Some think that the name cole slaw comes from &#34;caulis&#34;, the Latin word for cabbage.
