I don&#39;t love super sweet sloppy joes so I really liked the idea of an Italian version. I decided to make ours open faced so they would be easier to eat, I used less meat so it would be extra saucy, and I definitely like the idea of an openface sloppy joe, as you say they are so much easier to eat that way. This Sloppy Joe Casserole has ground beef and noodles smothered in a cheesy Manwich sauce with corn and diced tomatoes. Just prepare the filling in ONE POT.
