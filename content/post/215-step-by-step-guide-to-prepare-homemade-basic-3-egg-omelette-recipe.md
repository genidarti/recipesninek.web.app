recipeinstructions:
- "Set your ingredients and equipment out ready by the hob before you start cooking."
- "Place your frying pan on the hob over the lowest heat setting. Then add your eggs to the bowl or jug, add a pinch of salt and pepper and use your fork to whisk the eggs together until it becomes all one light yellow colour and has little air bubbles on the surface."
- "Place your butter in the pan and allow it to melt. If it sizzles wildly your pan is too hot. Remove the pan from the heat for a minute to let it cool down. Use your spatula to spread the butter over the base of the pan."
- "Now gently pour your beaten eggs into the pan. Swirl the pan so that the eggs cover the base. Then the heat of the hob up very slightly now to a low-medium. Use your spatula to scrape a line down through the middle of the omelette."
- "When the base starts to set, this action will draw a channel in the egg. Now tip your pan away from you to allow runny raw egg from the top of the omelette to run into the channel you have created."
- "Repeat this action several times until you have almost no runny egg on your omelette surface. If you lie, you can now fold your omelette, allow it to cook for another few minutes then serve."
- "Alternatively, you can add your filling here, we’ve used cheese in the example below. Sprinkle a small amount of cheddar on the surface, then gently use your spatula to fold the omelette in half. Allow it another few minutes on the heat before serving."
