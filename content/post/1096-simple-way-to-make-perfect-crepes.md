- "Add melted butter and mix again. Let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes in room temperature."
- "Warm the pan over medium heat. If you don&#39;t have a non-stick pan, add some butter to grease it. Then pour a ladle of batter into the pan and rotate the handle to create a circle shape with the batter. Turn over the crêpe when it&#39;s halfway done (= when the edges begin to rise). The easiest way to flip it is to turn it over with a spatula."
