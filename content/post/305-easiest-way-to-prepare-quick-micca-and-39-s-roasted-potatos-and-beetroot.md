You could use nugget potatoes and cut them in half if you have them, but since I wanted to use up at least SOME of the potatoes I have in my pantry, I cut full sized white and red potatoes. These crispy roasted Mexican Potatoes seasoned with chili powder, garlic, sea salt and Parmesan cheese are baked, not fried and are the perfect side to weekday meals. (gluten free, vegetarian).
