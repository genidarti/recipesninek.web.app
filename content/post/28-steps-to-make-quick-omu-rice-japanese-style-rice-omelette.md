recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil in the pan and sauté chicken and vegetables on medium heat. Season with ketchup, a pinch of salt and black pepper BEFORE adding the steamed rice. This is a tip to season evenly. Then add the rice and mix well."

- "It requires a small technique to shift the omurice to a plate. You can do as you like and find your way, but as for me, I set a plate just under the edge of the pan where the omurice is, and move the pan like to cover the plate.　　Make the shape wth kitchen cloth or paper if necessary. Enjoy with ketchup or tomato sauce or demi-glace sauce."
