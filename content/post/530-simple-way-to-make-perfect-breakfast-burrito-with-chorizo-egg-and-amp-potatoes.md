- "to taste Hot sauce"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat large skillet with your choice of oil. Add potatoes to the skillet and cover and cook on medium-high for 10 minutes. If potatoes and not frozen, add potatoes and warm on medium-high uncovered."
- "While potatoes are cooking, take out another skillet and only add non-stick spray (no oil here - chorizo produces enough). Once warm, add ground chorizo and cook on medium-high until meat is no longer pink."
- "Remove cover of potatoes and flip. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add chili powder, chipotle seasoning, and enough hot sauce to lightly cover the potatoes. Stir. Continue to cook potatoes until most are lightly crusted."

- "Warm and steam large torillas in the mircrowave for 20 seconds. I like to wet a paper towel and layer them. It&#39;s easier to fold that way."
- "Once tortillas are warm, add mexican cheese to the bottom, then potatoes, then chorizo, then eggs, and more cheese. Fold the burrito like they would at chipotle or whatever. Sides in, then roll bottom to top."
- "Optional - grill on a skillet!"
- "Top with more hot sauce (I used Diablo sauce from Taco Bell ;) and cheese."
- "Add side of potatoes, and enjoy!"
