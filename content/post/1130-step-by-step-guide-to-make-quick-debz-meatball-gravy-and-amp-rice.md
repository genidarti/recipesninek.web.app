recipeingredient:
- "15 Meatballs frozen or fresh"
- "1/2 Onion"
- "1 box Sliced mushrooms"
- "2 cup Chicken broth"
- "3 tbsp Lipton onion seasoning"
- "3 tbsp Flour"
- "1 Steamed rice"
- "1 Zucchini optional"
- "5 pats of Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "VEGGIE PREP: I bought a package of already sliced mushrooms so no slicing needed. You&#39;ll be sauteeing the mushrooms so they will shrink in size so no need to chop the mushrooms small (unless that&#39;s what you prefer). Chop your garlic and slice onions, set aside. My zucchini was on its way out so I chopped up those and will add to the dish."
- "COOKING PREPPED VEGGIES: Heat pan on med to med high with 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted, add garlic then mushrooms. Sautee for about 10 mins. They will have shrunken by then and maybe a bit carmelized. Put another pat of butter in the pan with mushrooms and add onions. Sautee until the onions are soft, but not mushy - about 10 mins. I put in my zucchini in at the same time with the onions. Sautee everything together. When sauteed and carmelized, set aside in glass dish or bowl until the gravy is ready"
- "MAKING THE GRAVY: Using the same pan that you sauteed veggies, heat 2-3 pats of butter on med high. Once melted, add flour to begin your roux. Mixing flour and melted butter with a whisk, brown flour for about 5 mins. The longer you cook the flour in butter, the darker the flour will get. If you like light colored gravy, no need to saute for 5 mins. I like my gravy dark plus cooking it longer cooks out the flour taste."
- "Add onion soup mix to the roux then immediately and slowly add the broth while mixing with the whisk. Continue to whisk the liquid and make sure there are no flour chunks. Bring temp down to med, allow to simmer and occasionally whisk for the next 3-4 min. If your gravy is too thick, add additional broth in 1/2 cup increments. If it looks like you have too much liquid, allow sauce to simmer longer."
- "Turn temp down to med low and add sauteed veggies and meatballs to the gravy. Allow to gently simmer for about 20 min or untill the meatballs are hot and cooked through."
- "Put rice on your plate and top with the meatball/gravy mixture. Top with chopped chives and sliced bread. Throw in some hot sauce for heat. ENJOY!"

##### Instructions to make Debz Meatball, Gravy &amp; Rice:

1. VEGGIE PREP: I bought a package of already sliced mushrooms so no slicing needed. You&#39;ll be sauteeing the mushrooms so they will shrink in size so no need to chop the mushrooms small (unless that&#39;s what you prefer). Chop your garlic and slice onions, set aside. My zucchini was on its way out so I chopped up those and will add to the dish.
1. COOKING PREPPED VEGGIES: Heat pan on med to med high with 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted, add garlic then mushrooms. Sautee for about 10 mins. They will have shrunken by then and maybe a bit carmelized. Put another pat of butter in the pan with mushrooms and add onions. Sautee until the onions are soft, but not mushy - about 10 mins. I put in my zucchini in at the same time with the onions. Sautee everything together. When sauteed and carmelized, set aside in glass dish or bowl until the gravy is ready
1. MAKING THE GRAVY: Using the same pan that you sauteed veggies, heat 2-3 pats of butter on med high. Once melted, add flour to begin your roux. Mixing flour and melted butter with a whisk, brown flour for about 5 mins. The longer you cook the flour in butter, the darker the flour will get. If you like light colored gravy, no need to saute for 5 mins. I like my gravy dark plus cooking it longer cooks out the flour taste.
1. Add onion soup mix to the roux then immediately and slowly add the broth while mixing with the whisk. Continue to whisk the liquid and make sure there are no flour chunks. Bring temp down to med, allow to simmer and occasionally whisk for the next 3-4 min. If your gravy is too thick, add additional broth in 1/2 cup increments.
