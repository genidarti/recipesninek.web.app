A true English Trifle has stale sponge (or sponge fingers) on the bottom topped with fresh fruit with a little juice (usually raspberries), then layered with FRESH custard (it must NOT be the type that sets), then whipped. The day before make the jelly so it has time to set then assemble and eat. Trifle is a traditional Christmas favourite. Celebrate with a splash of decadence, featuring layers of sweet jelly, fresh fruit, sponge and custard or cream.

Chill the jelly mixture before pouring into your trifle bowl so it&#39;s thick and syrupy, and just starting to set. Omit the alcohol if serving to kids, or make. Trifle must have jelly in it, otherwise its a glorified fruit salad. Sponge, jelly, fruit, custard and a topping of some description (or cream for topping but I don&#39;t like cream). The sponge should be soaked in Sherry, and the cream in brandy.
