recipeingredient:
- "100 g dried currants or raisins"
- "20 g brandy"
- "100 g wholemeal flour"
- "120 g plain flour"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "110 g butter softened"
- "110 g caster sugar"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "1/4 tsp nutmeg"
- "1/4 tsp mixed spice"
- "1 vanilla pod seeds scraped"
- "1 large egg beaten"
- " For the icing"
- "90 g icing sugar"
- "4 tsp milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the currants in a bowl or a zip lock bag, heat up the brandy in the microwave and pour it over the currants. Seal the bag or cover the bowl."
- "Mix both flours with the salt, dice in the butter and mix with an electric mixer until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir the spices and vanilla seeds from half the pod (leave the rest for the icing) into the caster sugar and add to the flour mixture. Add the egg and the currants and mix on low speed until it all just blends together – it will look very much like wet sand. Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead into a ball."
- "Roll it out to a disc about 1 ½ - 2cm thick. Using a 6cm round cookie cutter (scalloped if you have one) cut the biscuits and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment. They can go quite close together as they only spread a little."
- "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Bake the biscuits for 20 minutes until set and pale golden."
- "For the icing, mix the remaining vanilla seeds into milk in a small cup, warm it up a little in the microwave and pour into a bowl with icing sugar, beating well until smooth."
- "Remove the biscuits from the oven and brush them with icing straight away. Leave them to set and brush another layer on top. Leave them to cool completely."
