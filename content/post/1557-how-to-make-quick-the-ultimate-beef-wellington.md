recipeinstructions:
- "FOR THE DUXELLES:"

- "Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat."
- "Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most the liquid has evaporated."
- "Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool."
- "FOR THE BEEF:"
- "Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking."
- "Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board."
- "Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef."
- "Using a rubber spatula, cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles."
- "Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves."
- "When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine, and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard."
- "Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it nice and tight."
- "Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef."
- "Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape."
- "Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape."
- "Preheat the oven to 425째F."
- "On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about 1/4&#34; thickness."
- "Depending on the size of your sheets, you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together."
- "Remove beef from the refrigerator and cut off plastic."
- "Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef."
- "Top with coarse salt."
- "Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet."
- "Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife; this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking."
- "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125째F on an instant-read thermometer."
- "Remove from oven and rest 10 minutes before cutting into thick slices."
- "Garnish with minced chives and serve with green peppercorn sauce, roasted fingerling potatoes, and warm wilted winter greens."
- "FOR THE GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE:"
- "Add olive oil to pan after removing beef."
- "Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes."
- "Off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match."
- "After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock, and reduce by about half."
- "Strain out solids, then add 2 cups of cream and mustard."
- "Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns."
- "FOR THE ROASTED FINGERLING POTATOES with FRESH HERBS &amp; GARLIC:"
- "Preheat oven to 500째F and place a baking sheet inside to heat."
- "Add potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl."
- "Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper."

##### Instructions to make The Ultimate Beef Wellington:

1. FOR THE DUXELLES:
1. Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.

1. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most the liquid has evaporated.
1. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.
1. FOR THE BEEF:
1. Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking.
1. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board.
1. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef.
1. Using a rubber spatula, cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles.
1. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves.
1. When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine, and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard.
1. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it nice and tight.
1. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef.

1. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.
1. Preheat the oven to 425째F.

1. Top with coarse salt.
1. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet.
1. Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife; this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking.
