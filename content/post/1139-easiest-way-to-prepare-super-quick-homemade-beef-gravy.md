- " Beef juices"
- " Water I use hot or warm water so itll heat up faster"

- " Cornstarch"
- " Salt"
- " Black pepper"
- " Garlic powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take beef juices from pan and put into a saucepan. Use a little less than the amount you want of gravy. (example: if you wanted half a saucepan of gravy, use enough beef juices to get close to half since you&#39;ll be adding water.)"
- "Add salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste."
- "On medium/high heat, stir occasionally until the beef juices begin to boil."
- "Once boiling, add some beef bouillon cubes for added flavor"
- "Add a bit of hot or warm water to compensate for the added bouillon cubes."
- "Bring back up to a low boil."
- "Once at a boil, take a small cup and add a few teaspoons of the cornstarch and mix in a bit of water. Mix well until it is all combined. (This step is so you don&#39;t end up with lumps of cornstarch in your gravy.) Once mixed well, add to your gravy mixture."
- "Keep mixing with a wire whisk so nothing burns. Gravy will start to thicken shortly. If it&#39;s not thick enough for you, add more cornstarch by repeating the previous step."
- "When gravy is at desired thickness you&#39;re done! Take off heat and serve, enjoy!"
