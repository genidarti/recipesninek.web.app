recipeingredient:
- "10-15 ears corn fresh is best canned frozen will work"
- "8-10 Cucumbers roughly peeled and diced"
- "15-20 Cherry Tomatoes quartered"
- "1 large red pepper diced"
- "1 large green pepper diced"
- "1/2 Onion diced"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "2 jalapenos minced"
- " Dressing"
- "3 Tbsp olive oil"
- "2 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar"
- "2 Tbsp Lemon Juice"
- "2 Tbsp Lime Juice"
- "1 1/2 Tbsp Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get all your ingredients together, and use the counts and measurements in my ingredients list above loosely. If you have more corn or less cucumbers its still a salad :)"
- "If you are using fresh corn go ahead and blanch it for 5 minutes in boiling salted water, remove from pot to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. After the corn has cooled cut the kernels from the cob using the old bunt cake pan method."
- "Then you peel, chop, dice all the veggies you are using. Place in a giant bowl and stir. I roughly peel my home grown cucumbers but if you are using store bought with the wax coating you are going to want to remove all the peeling."
- "Put together dressing ingredients or use any store bought vinaigrette style dressing you want. If you are going to eat this all week (as I plan to) avoid adding salt until serving as it will pull moisture from the veggies and all the extra juice ruins the fresh taste. Also store in a flat cassarole style dish to prevent all those juices congregating at the bottom and ruining your presentation. I hope you enjoy!"
