recipeinstructions:
- "First off, wash the rice and boil it for six minutes, when the tiny bubbles form on the surface, switch off the gas and strain the rice. Add some white oil and mix it with the strained rice, otherwise the starch in the rice can make it sticky. (We need a rice that&#39;s 30% boiled)"
- "Next, marinate the prawn and sausage with some lemon, salt, pepper and some sweet chilli and fry it separately. After frying, keep the prawn aside and chop the sausages."
- "Try to follow a recipe to make the tomato puree at home or just buy a canned puree. Homemade tomato puree is easy. Boil two tomatoes, peel the skin off, add some onion and grind it into a paste. Then slightly fry in oil the puree with some salt, garlic and vinegar and strain it. The taste becomes better than canned ones."
- "I used pre cooked pork since red meat takes a lot of time to soften and paella will be overcooked if we use uncooked pork."

- "When it starts to boil, add some saffron. And then add the pre-boiled rice."
- "Add the rice in a certain fashion. Start spreading the rice in longitudinal order and don&#39;t stir the rice. Reduce the flame and cover the pan for 6-7 mins"
- "After 7 mins you can see that the rice is cooked and a little mushy. Paella is supposed to be mushy."
- "Place the fried prawns on top and cover the pan. Switch off the gas. I will show you a photo of the ready paella after I already had my first serving though."
- "The sauce is really easy. To the grinder jar, add the garlic paste with 2 spoons of yogurt, 1 spoon cream, 1 spoon lemon juice and some lemon zest. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of sugar. Run it in the grinder. The garlic tinge should be high in the sauce."
- "Now a foodie&#39;s picture of how you are supposed to eat it."
