- "1/4 cup shortening"
- "1 cup Milk"

- "Cut rounds with a biscuit cutter (or use the top of a large martini shaker like I do. :) ). Place on a baking sheet. Biscuits should be touching. Bake for 12 minutes."
- "While biscuits are baking melt TBSP of butter in the pan that the sausage was browned in."
- "Once butter is melted, stir in TBSP of flour and make a roux. Add a pinch of salt. Cook roux for 3-5 minutes."
