recipeingredient:
- "1 big onion"
- "5 palm sized potatoes"
- "5 eggs"
- "1 sunflower oil"
- "1 salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel all five potatoes and soak in very salty water while you are at it. Remember potatoes absorb salt but they need lots of it to actually taste salt."
- "Slice the potatoes length wise and cut into thin half moons, I cut them half a cm wide, this will make them cook quicker. while doing so leave in water so they don&#39;t oxidize and change color."
- "Peel and finely chop the onion. If you don&#39;t like onions you can leave it out, but this ingredient makes the Basque omelet tasty and juicy."
- "In a frying pan pour some oil, make sure it is tasteless like sunflower oil, and slowly at a low heat wait until the onion turns translucent and sprinkle with salt. Once reached that point set them aside in a big bowl and try not to eat it."
- "Pour more oil in the pan and wait until hot. The perfect moment to through a handful of sliced potatoes is when the tip of a toothpick or chopstick bubbles in the oil."
- "Carefully (!!!) rinse the potatoes and let a handful fry in the oil. You will know the potatoes are fried when you can easily cut them by poking them with a wooden spoon. Take those out carefully, hot oil burns are very painful, and put them in the bowl with the onion. Repeat until some with all the potatoes."
- "When done with all the potatoes mix them well with the onions in the bowl. Check for any hard piece of potato and sprinkle more salt if you feel it needs it."
- "Beat the eggs one by one to avoid mixing in a rotten one and damaging the whole recipe. When all mixed, if you have time, let it rest at room temperature so that the flavors blend. If you think you might need another egg now is the moment. The potatoes should be coated in egg and there should be a little more."
- "You&#39;ll use that same frying pan, but first pour out the oil into a jar to use for other recipes it is very tasteful and can make anything taste better! Before pouring make sure to put a metal spoon in the jar or the glass might crack."
- "Depending on how big your pan is you&#39;ll need more time to show cook it, or less. The pan will also be important to determine the thickness of the Basque omelet. The thicker it is, the lower the heat and longer the cooking. I like mine thin, about an inch high, so depends on the pan I have at hand I&#39;ll get two small Tortilak or a big one. The potatoes should be covered in egg when in the pan, if not you&#39;ll get a beautiful side and a side with holes. If you realize it after pouring into the pan, before placing it on the other side to cook beat an egg and pour it right before slipping the uncooked side on it. It&#39;ll still look nice and taste delicious."
- "With about a table spoon of oil in the pan pour your mix into the pan and shake the handle sideways to assure it doesn&#39;t stick. Once you see the edges cooked place a big dish on the pan and, once again, with lots of caution turn the Basque omelet over. Keep your hand on the dish wide open, do not be scared, and flip them both together until you have the pan over the omelet on the dish.  If it sticks do not fret, just put it all back into the bowl and beat another egg into it and try again with a little more oil."
- "Pour a little of oil in the pan for the second side and help yourself with a wooden spoon or spatula to slip it on the pan, cooked side up, and tuck the sides in to make it curve on the edges. Some like it very cooked and dry, others prefer it juicy and thin, you&#39;ll eventually figure your Basque omelet. Remember what makes it juicy is the onion, if you wish leave it out, put only half or dry it before moving into the bowl."
- "When both sides are cooked, you can flip it again to check if both sides have the same color or to cook it done more if you like it dry. Once you are done place it on a dish and serve hot, warm or cold with a simple salad (lettuce, tomatoes and onion) and some bread (baguette or Italian)."
- "I like to serve mine with some red roasted peppers macerated in oil and slowly cooked until oil has thickened. I use some peppers to decorate the top with a Basque Lauburu."
