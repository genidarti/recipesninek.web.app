recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "1 tsp Instant dry yeast"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "3/5 tsp Salt"
- "140 ml Milk"
- "15 grams Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the milk and the butter in a heat-resistant cup and microwave at 500 W for 30 seconds or until warm to the touch."
- "Place the flour in a heat-resistant bowl. Put the yeast on top of the flour. Add the sugar and salt away from the yeast."
- "Pour in Step 1, aiming for the yeast. Leave it just like that for 1 minute."
- "Knead it and bring it all together for 3 minutes while occasionally knocking the bowl against the counter."
- "Cover the surfaces of the dough with plastic wrap and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Microwave for 2 minutes at 150 W."
- "Remove from the microwave and let it rise. (About 30 minutes.) To check the rising, see the bubbles on the bottom of the bowl."
- "Another way to check the rising is if you poke the dough with a floured finger and the hole doesn&#39;t fill in. That means it&#39;s ready!"
- "Grease the pan with shortening. Divide the dough into 4 portions, round them, and place into the pan. You don&#39;t need to let the dough rest  here."
- "Let the dough rise a second time until doubled in size. I usually use the bread rising function of my oven, 20 minutes at 40°C."
- "Bake it without preheating the oven! As the oven is heating to 190°C, when it reaches 100°C, place the dough inside. Leave in the oven until it has reached 190°C."
- "Once the oven has reached 190°C, bake the bread for 15 minutes. (The amount of time it takes to bake will depend on your oven, so keep an eye on it until the very end.)"
