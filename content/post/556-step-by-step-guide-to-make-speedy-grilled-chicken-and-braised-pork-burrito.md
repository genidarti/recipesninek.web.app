Farm assured british chicken marinated overnight in our special blend of smoked ancho peppers &amp; spices. Toasty-brown burritos are filled with a spicy pork and bean mixture and melted Cheddar cheese. Divide the pork mixture evenly among the tortillas. Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling and then fold up the ends to enclose the filling, moistening the edges with water. These burritos were made with left over pork we had from a pig roast.
