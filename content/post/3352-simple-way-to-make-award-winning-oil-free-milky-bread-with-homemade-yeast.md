recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread flour 100"
- "140 ml Milk"
- "80 grams Homemade natural yeast starter"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Leave the kneading up to the bread maker. Add the milk, homemade natural yeast, sugar, and bread flour into the bread container, add in the salt last, and start it on the dough making course. After it has finished kneading, take it out of the bread pan, roll it up in a lightly greased bowl, wrap in plastic wrap or cover with a lid, and let rise for the first time."
- "It has swelled up to 3-4 times the size. It should take about 5-6 hours at 30°C room temperature. Gather the dough to the side with a dredge etc so you don&#39;t damage it, take it out with a knife, and divide into 8 portions with a scraper (as big as you like)."
- "After dividing it, roll up the dough so that the surface is plump, cover with a well-wrung out cloth, and let rest for about 10-15 minutes."
- "Roll it back up, line it up on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet , cover with a wet cloth, and let rise for the second time."
- "It has swelled up to about twice the size. It&#39;ll take about 2 hours at maybe 30°C room temperature."
- "Start preheating the oven to 180°C for 20 minutes. Cut a cross into the tops while waiting. Do so as if cutting through one layer. The surface is a bit wet, so it will be easier to do if you let it dry out a little first."
- "Bake in the preheated oven until it turns a nice golden brown, and it&#39;s done. Please adjust the temperature based on the type of oven."
- "This is a non cut version made with 14ml milk. It will turn out taller when you don&#39;t cut it. Using more milk also makes it milder and springier . It is sticky and hard to shape, so dust your hands with flour.."
