recipeinstructions:
- "In a large skillet over medium heat crumble and brown sausage until fully cooked. About 10 minutes. Add diced red pepper and cook 2 minutes more."
- "Turn off heat. Gently stir in black olives, green chiles and ranch dressing mix until well incorporated. Let cool while you prep the wonton wrappers."
- "Preheat oven to 350°F and pull out a couple muffin tins. Lay 24 wrappers in a single layer on a clean work surface. Brush lightly with olive oil. Flip and brush the other side with olive oil. (I have 2, 12 count muffin tins so I work 24 wrappers at a time and place both tins in oven at once.)"
