I had tried a few store-bought varieties over the years, but never attempted it at home until recently. Adding instant pudding to your cookie dough is a simple trick to amp up the flavor, but also to keep the cookies soft. Make sure you&#39;re using instant pudding, not &#34;cook and serve&#34;. The coagulants in the &#34;cook and serve&#34; are different than the instant, containing a large amount of cornstarch.
