- "Roll into &#34;ping pong&#34; size balls. Pop into freezer to hardened for about 10 - 15 minutes. During that time, melt chocolate, I like using both dark and white, semi-sweet works well for a less sweet coating. Also, adding a bit of shortening to melted morsels (not bark!) Helps get a smooth finish."

If easier, tilt bowl so chocolate makes a deeper &#34;puddle&#34; and drop ball into it while quickly rolling it in the chocolate"
- "Place on wax paper or even foil. If you have neither, a plate or metal pan that will fit in freezer should be fine,( once cold enough you can just pluck them off the pan or plate. ) while wet, sprinkle left over crumbs on truffle or use sprinkles."
- "Decorate or just leave as is, place in candy cups if you want, and enjoy!"
