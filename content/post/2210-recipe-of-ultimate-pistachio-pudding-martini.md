Next time, skip a decadent dessert and reach straight for this cocktail. I found almond flavoring listed as an ingredient in the instant pistachio pudding mix, as well as in several brands of pistachio ice cream. So, to enhance what our taste buds have come to know and love as that &#34;pistachio&#34; dessert flavor, I added extra almond extract to these pistachio muffins to bump up the flavor. Pistachio pudding, whipped topping, mandarin oranges, fruit cocktail, pineapple, bananas, and miniature marshmallows star in this classic dessert salad. To serve, cover the top of each with the grated chocolate, add a layer of chopped pistachio nuts, and top with a maraschino cherry.
