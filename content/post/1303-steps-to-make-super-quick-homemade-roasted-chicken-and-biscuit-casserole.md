recipeinstructions:
- "Pre heat oven to 385°"
- "Cover all sides of each piece of chicken with the spice blend, put in a greased baking dish and bake for an hour and a half covered with foil."
- "In a large pot sweat the celery and carrots with the remaining dry spices."
- "When the chicken is done place the thighs into a mixing bowl and let cool. Set the baking dish aside and let stand to let to cool so the fat separates and rises to the top of the juices."
- "Prepare the biscuit dough."

- "Pour mix into the baking dish over top the chicken and smooth to an even layer."
- "Use a scoop to evenly drop the biscuit dough over the top."
- "Place the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake uncovered for about and hour... this is all based on how your oven cooks. You&#39;re looking for a good color on the biscuits, the sauce bubbling and the underside of the biscuits to not be raw."
