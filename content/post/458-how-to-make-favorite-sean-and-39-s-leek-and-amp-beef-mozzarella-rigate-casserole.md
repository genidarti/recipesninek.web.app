The leek is a vegetable, a cultivar of Allium ampeloprasum, the broadleaf wild leek. The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Leek substitutes are relatively easy to find, due to the range of closely related vegetables. Tiiu Leek was born to Estonian refugees in Montreal, Canada and raised in Toronto.
