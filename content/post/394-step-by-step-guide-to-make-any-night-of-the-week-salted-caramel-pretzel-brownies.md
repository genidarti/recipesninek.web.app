- " brownie mix"
- " pretzels use as many as needed"
- " caramel sauce use as much as needed"
- " coarse sea salt just enough to sprinkle on top"
- " parchment paper optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare brownies according to package instructions. Pour 1/3 of the batter into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan that has been lined with parchment paper or greased with cooking spray.  Spread the batter so that it forms an even layer to coat the bottom of the pan."
- "Lay the pretzels down in an even layer on top of the brownie batter, then add a second even layer of the pretzels and then the rest of the brownie batter. Try and spread it as best as you can. Even if it&#39;s not covered all the way the batter on the bottom will rise through the pretzels and the batter on the top will spread."
- "Then bake the brownies in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean."
- "Once the brownies are out, spoon some caramel sauce onto the top of the brownies. And smooth it out to form an even layer."
- "Sprinkle with some coarse sea salt.  And then once the brownies have cooled, lift them out of the pan if you used parchment paper for easy cutting and cut them into bars. (Or you can cut them in the pan.) Enjoy!"
