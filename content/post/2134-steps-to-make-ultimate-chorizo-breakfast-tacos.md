In these breakfast tacos, the chorizo is browned THEN the egg is cooked in the same pan so it can soak up all the flavours of the chorizo. That&#39;s why the egg has a slightly brown tinge to it - it&#39;s all. Saute the chorizo until cooked through. I&#39;m always on the fence about breakfast tacos and burritos - usually because I want some sort of pork and queso cheese in my tacos and I don&#39;t always love sausage but when I do… it&#39;s usually chorizo. These breakfast tacos are only as spicy as the chorizo and salsa that you choose but they Sauté chorizo sausage in heavy medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through.
