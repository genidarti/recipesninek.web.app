- "5 garlic cloves"
- "1 tbsp fajita seasoning"
- "2 cups shredded cheese  optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a slow cooker, add water, bullion cube, taco seasoning &amp; garlic all mixed together. Top with chicken. Low 6-7hrs, high 3-4. Mine were semi frozen so I cooked them on high 5 hrs"
- "Remove chicken &amp; shred. Pour all broth into large bowl &amp; reserve. Mash garlic in the bottom of crockpot &amp; leave for now"

- "With a slotted spoon, scoop the mixture onto the tortilla, making sure the least amount of juice gets in the tortilla.  Sprinkle cheese on top. You want to leave 3/4 to 1 inch on each end for accurate folding."
- "Once folded, add to a med high griddle or non-stick pan. I add a tiny butter to get a crispy outer edge. Flip burritos until golden on both sides."
- "These can be served with salsa, sour cream, guacamole or enjoyed the way they are!! I hope you enjoy!"
