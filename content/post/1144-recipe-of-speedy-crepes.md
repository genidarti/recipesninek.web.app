- "Put a cube or less of butter/ margarine into a heating pan, not too much, just enough to coat the pan. Butter works best because of its huge flavor, and makes the crepes or pancakes taste yummy. You can use vegetable oil as well. Lightly pour the batter mixture (easy to use the 1/4 measuring cup for even size crepes) Swirl the pan to evenly coat the pan. Cook until the crepe is golden turn and cook the other side the same. Repeat the procedure with the rest of the batter."
- "Serve while hot with fruits of choice. I like to fold like in the picture and tuck in bananas (saw the trick on food network ðŸ˜œ) You can sprinkle marple syrup or honey as well and enjoy."
- "I add vanilla extract to â€˜chaseâ€™ away the egg smell or taste. This way, I can eat even when cold."
