Serve white sauce pasta garnished with some fresh herbs like parsley, chives or dill. You can also garnish with some grated cheddar cheese. I made it exactly as posted, and it was very good like that. I had some steamed asparagus leftover from last night, so I chopped and heated it and threw it in as well.
