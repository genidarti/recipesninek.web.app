- "1 Sponge cake 15 cm diameter"
- "2 Eggs"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "200 ml Strong coffee or espresso"
- "200 grams Mascarpone"
- "1 Cocoa powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "These are the ingredients. For the sake of saving time, I&#39;m using instant coffee.  (Making espresso in advance is better still!)"
- "Add 3 tablespoons of sugar to the 2 egg yolks, then mix them together with a whisk until they look whitish."
- "Add the 200 g of mascarpone to the mixture from Step 2 and whisk again."
- "Now, let&#39;s make the meringue. Add some sugar to the egg whites to taste, and whip it until stiff peaks form (using a hand mixer)."
- "Add your meringue from Step 5 to the mascarpone from Steps 3~4 in several batches and mix the two together after each addition. Be careful not to over-mix."
- "In order to save time, I used the container that the sponge cake came in. Open the cake tin, throw away the protection paper and preservation agent, and gently wipe the container after you&#39;ve removed the sponge cake."
- "Place the first of the two sponge cake layers in the container and drizzle it with half of the strong coffee to soak it thoroughly."
- "Pour half of the mixture from Step 6 on top of the coffee-soaked sponge cake."
- "Place the other layer of sponge cake on top of the meringue mixture poured in during Step 9, and soak in the rest of the coffee in the same way as before."
- "Pour the rest of the mixture from Step 6 on top of the cake, then shake the container gently to even out the surface of the cake."
- "After you use tea strainer to sprinkle the top of the cake with cocoa powder, it&#39;s finished."
- "You can eat it as is, or you can chill it in the fridge for a few hours, as the amount of the meringue used in this cake is more than what you&#39;d use for a normal tiramisu."
- "After chilling it for about 4 hours, it cuts very nicely. However, it tends to have a smoother texture at room temperature. Enjoy the fluffiness of the cake!"
