recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup coconut flour 200280 cal  depend on fiber calc"
- "1/4 cup unsweetened chocolate powder 60 cal"
- "2 teaspoons baking powder"
- "6 Tablespoons Egg whites 50 cal"
- "1/2 cup splenda"
- "1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt 70 cal"
- "1/2 cup water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat stove to 425"
- "Combine all of the above together, it will be a very fluffy, biscuit dough. Let it sit for a bit so the coconut flour absorbs its liquids"
- "Using a spoon, ice cream, measuring whatever. Spoon out your 10-12 biscuits onto a cookie baking sheet. The original author used a ice cream scoop, I used a big dinner spoon. Whatever works. They will not spread or swell ever very much."
- "Bake for 12-15, until they don&#39;t wiggle to touch, I went for 15 as they seemed to still be a little wiggles at 12."
- "Let them rest until cool, Longer they sit uncovered and unbagged they will continue to harden to the point of biscotti after a few days exposed."
- "I may try to twice bake them, as traditional biscotti is done. The second bake might dry them out quicker. I may tinker with the amount of water/yogurt as well. These things seem quite awesome once hardened so any way to quicken the hardening process the better."
