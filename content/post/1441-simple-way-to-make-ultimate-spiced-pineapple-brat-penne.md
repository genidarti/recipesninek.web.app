recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-cook the brats: Place brats and chicken broth in a large, deep sided saute pan over medium high heat. Cover and gently simmer for 10 minutes, turning once. Transfer brats to plate to cool slightly. Drain chicken broth from pan, reserving for later."
- "While brats cook, mix all ingredients for the spice mix together in a small bowl until well combined (set aside), and prep your veggies. You can also begin the pasta now (or while sauce is simmering). Just prepare to package directions, Drain and set aside."
- "Once emptied, return pan to burner over medium heat. Add 2 tbs butter and 1 tsp oil. When butter is melted add peppers and onions. Saute until onions just begin to soften slightly, stirring frequently. About 5 minutes."
- "While veggies cook, slice brats into 1/4&#34;-1/2&#34; slices. Add brat slices to veggies and continue cooking until browned slightly, only stirring or tossing occasionally. About another 5-7 minutes more."
- "Add 1/2 cup reserved chicken broth and all of pineapple juice to pan. Add spice mix and stir to combine. Turn heat up to medium high, vigorously simmer uncovered until sauce has reduced by almost half. Should be about another 10-15 minutes."
- "When sauce has reduced, turn heat down to medium low and stir in sweet Thai chili sauce until combined. You want the sauce to have a little body/thickness to it."
- "Turn off heat, taste sauce for seasoning and adjust as desired, I added an extra pinch of salt. Add prepared penne to sauce, stir or toss gently to coat. Serve immediately, top with fresh grated parmesan if desired and enjoy!"
- "See additional notes below ‚§µ"
- "NOTE1: My hubby likes his cooked pepper &amp; onions to be very soft, so I cooked them the entire time. If you want yours to be a little firmer, remove from pan while you brown up the brats and return when you add the liquids."
- "NOTE2: You may also save any remaining chicken broth for a future recipe if desired, it has taken on the flavor of the brats while cooking."
- "NOTE3: pineapple brats are a slightly sweetened, spiced brat with pineapple notes made by the butcher at"
- "Note4: If the sauce seems too thin you may thicken slightly with a slurry of 2 tsp cornstarch &amp; 3 tsp cold water wicked together, stir into sauce and simmer just until it begins to thicken (I did this with mine to ensure the sauce really clung to the pasta)."
