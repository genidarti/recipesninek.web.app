- "Once the mixture is not foamy, beat from the bottom until stiff peaks form when you lift the beaters. Finally fluff it up by beating on low speed for 10 seconds."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolk well with a whisk. Mix in the banana while mashing. It will become creamy when it is done."
- "Next, add the water and mix well. Add the sifted flour and mix well with the whisk until well blended."

- "Even though this is a non-oil recipe, I recommend you top with some butter or margarine while still hot and let it melt in residual heat."
