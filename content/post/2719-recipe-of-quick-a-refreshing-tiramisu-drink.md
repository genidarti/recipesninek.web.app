recipeingredient:
- "100 ml Mitsuya Cider a clear carbonated soda similar to Sprite or 7Up"
- "100 ml Milk"
- "2 tsp Instant coffee powder"
- "1 bit less than 1 teaspoon Lemon juice"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 tbsp to taste Skim milk powder"
- "1 as topping Cocoa powder optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the instant coffee powder and skim milk powder together. Dissolve them both in milk. Pour in the Mitsuya Cider soda. Mix in the sugar and lemon juice and it&#39;s done!"
- "It&#39;s best to mix in the sugar at the end instead of at the beginning for a more tiramisu-like flavor. The key is to add more than 1 tablespoon."
- "I thought it tasted like tiramisu even without the cocoa powder, but add to taste. If you use the sweetened type, mix it in at the end before drinking."
- "I tried making it with zero-calorie Mitsuya Cider soda. Since the calories are reduced a lot by using a diet soda, I thought it tasted best with lots of skim milk powder and sweetened cocoa powder to add richness."
- "By varying the amounts just a bit, the flavor really changes to something very different. I think it tastes best with a generous amount of sugar, and with sweetened cocoa powder on top."
