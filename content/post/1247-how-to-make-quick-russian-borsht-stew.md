- "1 1/2 lb beef stew chunks"

- "4 oz canned chopped tomato"
- "4 cup filtered water"
- "1 salt and pepper to taste"
- "1 tbsp sour cream per serving"
recipeinstructions:
- "In large stew pot: melt butter and then add onions, garlic, and beef. Heat on med-high until outside of beef is browned."
- "Remove beef from pot and chop into bite-sized chunks. Return to pot and add potatoes, beets, carrots, celery, canned tomato, and water to pot. Cover and simmer for 1 hr or until beef is tender."
- "Add salt and pepper as necessary. Serve with a spoonful of sour cream."
