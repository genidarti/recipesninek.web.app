recipeinstructions:
- "Par-cook your taters. I like to put mine in a saucepan, cover with cold water and add the 2 Tbsps kosher salt. Bring to a boil and cook for ~10 mins. Remove taters, set aside to cool completely (at least 3 hours - can be done a few days in advance and chilled). Then cut in half lengthwise and slice into 1/2 inch ‚Äúhalf moons‚Äù. Set aside."
- "Pour yourself a drink - you deserve it. You‚Äôre making dinner!!"
- "In a large fry pan, cook diced bacon low and slow (well, actually medium low heat) to render out the fat (you‚Äôll need ~ 3 Tbsps fat). Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon and add to a plate lined with paper towels."
- "Add to the bacon fat your sliced shallots or onion (and veggies if you so choose). Saut√© on medium heat until tender. Remove to a bowl and set aside."
- "Take sip - I‚Äôm thirsty! üçπüçπ"
- "Add 1 Tbsps butter to the fry pan and add your first layer of cooled tater-half-moons. Do NOT crowd the pan. Season lightly with salt, pepper and smoked paprika. Brown to your liking on one side, then flip and and brown lightly. Remove to a separate plate. Repeat with following layers, add more butter if needed. Keep going until the last layer of potatoes are in the fry pan and flipped."
- "Add all the fried taters and veggies back to the pan and cover with cheese. Turn heat down to low or medium-low (you know your stove) and cover with a lid for ~3-5 mins until cheese is melted. Or if you prefer brown and bubbly, put your OVEN-SAFE pan under the broiler uncovered for a few minutes (DO NOT LEAVE UNSUPERVISED - or have really good home/renters insurance)"
- "Phew!!!! That was stressful! I need a drink."
- "Top your amazing taters and cheese with the cooked bacon. By this time you need a refill üç∏. Then plate and enjoy!"
