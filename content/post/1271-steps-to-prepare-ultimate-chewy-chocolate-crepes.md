recipeinstructions:
- "Put the bread flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt into a large bowl. Use unsweetened cocoa powder."
- "Mix the dry ingredients from Step 1 well with a whisk. You will strain the batter later, so there&#39;s no need to sift."
- "Add the egg and about 1/3 of the milk and mix well (no need to warm up the milk)."
- "When you&#39;re done mixing, it will look like this."
- "Add the rest of the milk and mix. If you&#39;re using rum, mix it in now. It&#39;s just for fragrance, so it&#39;s optional!"
- "Strain."
- "The batter will look like this after straining."
- "Add the oil to a very hot frying pan. Lightly wipe off the excess oil. If the pan is not very hot, the crepes will stick to the pan."
- "Use about 80% of a ladle full of batter to make 1 crepe."
- "Turn the pan by twisting your wrist to quickly spread out the crepe batter evenly in the pan."
- "When the crepe starts to brown, go around the edge of the pan use cooking chopsticks to lift the edges of the crepe."
- "Lift up the edge of the crepe with cooking chopsticks and then use your hand to flip it. Cook for a few seconds."
- "Place the crepes on a cutting board to cool.  It&#39;s ok to stack them in layers, and you&#39;ll be able to pull them apart easily."

- "Put some ice cream on top of the whipped cream and pour the chocolate sauce over it."
- "In the photo above, I tied the crepe into a ball. If you squeeze tightly, the shape will turn out nicely, but after awhile it will loosen, so you may want to tie it with a ribbon or something to secure."
- "The filling is the same in these ones! For Step 17, fold all sides of the crepe and wrap it up. Flip it over and top with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and strawberries."
