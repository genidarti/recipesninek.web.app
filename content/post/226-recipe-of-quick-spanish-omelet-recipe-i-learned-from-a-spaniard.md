recipeingredient:
- "3 to 4 Eggs"
- "2 large Potatoes"
- "1/2 Onion"
- "5 tbsp Olive oil"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop the onion into about 1 cm cubes."
- "In a small skillet, heat the olive oil and fry the onion slowly over low heat until golden.  Use a generous amount of oil to &#34;simmer&#34; rather than frying."
- "While the onion is &#34;simmering&#34;, cut the potatoes into cubes. ※ Do not soak the potatoes in water.  This is important!"
- "Add the potatoes from Step 3 into the skillet and mix with onion briefly.  Cover and braise them in the oil.  ※ Cook it over low heat also."
- "Meanwhile, crack and beat the eggs in a large bowl."
- "Open the lid occasionally and stir the potatoes and onions, season them slightly strongly with salt and pepper, and cover again.  Repeat this process for about 5 minutes."
- "Once the potatoes are tender, add the ingredients from Step 6 into the beaten eggs and stir lightly.  ※ Remove excess oil if there is too much."
- "Return the mixture from Step 7 into the skillet, cover and cook it for about 5 minutes.  The eggs will puff up. ※ The heat should still be low."
- "Once the bottom side is cooked, cover the skillet with a large plate.  Grab the handle of the skillet from the bottom and flip it quickly to transfer the omelet onto the plate.  The cooked side should be on top now."
- "The non-cooked side should be on the bottom, so slide it back to the skillet.  Cover and cook the bottom side.  ※ Still on low heat."
- "Cook it for about 3 minutes or until golden brown and it is done -✩"
- "※ The secret to flipping the omelet is to grab the handle of the skillet from the bottom, cover the skillet tightly with a plate and flip it all at once ✩"
