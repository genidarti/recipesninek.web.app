recipeinstructions:
- "Combine cake flour, sugar, and salt (and baking powder, if making Mille Crêpe) in a bowl. Whisk to break any lumps. Add eggs and mix well."
- "When smooth, add milk in several batches. Mix some more until smooth. If you add all the milk in one go, the batter will get lumpy."
- "Now add the vegetable oil and vanilla oil, and continue to mix. The batter will be nice and smooth. It might look nice, but there may be lumps hiding underneath."
- "Pass the batter through a sieve to remove any lumps or impurities. Finally, the batter is really smooth. At this point, you should heat the frying pan."
- "Lightly grease the frying pan and pour in one ladleful of the batter. Spread it out quickly to cook. When using a non-stick frying pan, you don&#39;t need any oil."
- "When the edges dry and raise, insert a chopstick on the bottom. Turn and roll the crepe up to flip over."
- "Cook for a few seconds, and it&#39;s done. Spread it out onto a serving plate. When the other batches are done, layer them together. You could make 7 to 8 crepes that are 25 cm in diameter."
- "Serve with toppings of your choice, or fold in any filling to finish. It&#39;s actually quite firm and easy to handle."
- "With some cake syrup and powdered sugar. I served some to my kids with whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles, and bananas. They loved it!"
- "So moist chewy, airy, and delicious. Fold them up to make layers."
- "In this photo, I sandwiched some whipped cream and thinly sliced bananas to make a mille crêpe cake. I used 150 ml heavy cream and 3 bananas. I used a 20 cm frying pan."
- "This one is a chestnut cream mille crêpe cake."
