recipeingredient:
- "4 large tomatoes diced small"
- "1 medium onion chopped finely"
- "1 handful basil finely chopped"
- "4 clove garlic finely minced"
- "1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1 tbsp salt for insalata"
- "15 halfinch slices pork loin seasoned"
- "10 lb potatoes washed and cut into sixths"
- "1 stick butter"
- "1 tbsp salt for potatoes"
- "1 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1 cup milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil in a large pan enough water to cover the potatoes, and then add the potatoes."
- "Drain the potatoes, and set aside for a moment."
- "Add the first six ingredients into a medium mixing bowl, lightly toss to mix, and set aside."
- "Season the pork loin, and, by that, I mean salt and pepper (and granulated garlic, if you are like me) them to your liking, and place them into a single layer in a very large flat pan."
- "Broil the pork a few minutes on each side, about 6 or 7 minutes per side, I&#39;d say, until the loin is just barely cooked through.  You need to keep an eye on it every other minute or so.  Set it aside."
- "Now add the butter and salt and milk to the potatoes, and mash to a nice consistency.  I like little lumps in my mashed potatoes, but to each his or her own."
- "OK, plating!  One to two half cup plops of mashed potatoes on a plate, depending on whether you have a hunger like a beast, incline slice one of the loins and use your knife to gently lift the whole sliced loin onto the potatoes, add a little liquid from the pan over the loin and potatoes, and then generously adorn the loin with the insalata."
- "OK, eating!  Get a little bit of the potatoes and the pork and the insalata in every bite.  I think it works with either white or red wine."
