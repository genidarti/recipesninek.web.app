I have to tell you that this pudding was much better than the custard and required no baking. Coconut cream is similar to coconut milk, but is thicker and creamy. You get a more intense flavour and creamy consistency than coconut milk plus some liquid added to the recipe which works well for these dishes - coconut and cardamom rice pudding and couscous. In our humble opinion, coconut milk is the most underrated ingredient in your pantry.

The canned (and sometimes boxed) liquid is different from coconut water, which is the clear liquid found inside a coconut. Homemade coconut milk creamer for coffee is crazy easy to make. All you need is quality coconut milk, a healthy sweetener like honey and natural extract. I usually start my day with a cup of organic coffee with coconut milk creamer, sweetener and gelatin (for protein and to balance the carbs and fat). This trick is simple: Chill a can of coconut milk, then scoop out the coconut fat that separates out and solidifies (leaving the watery liquid behind), and whip it just like whipped cream.
