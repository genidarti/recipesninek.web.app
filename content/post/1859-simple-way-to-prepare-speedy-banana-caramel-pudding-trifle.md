About the runniness, try cooking the pudding longer, just before it becomes the consistency of pudding. If you like Bananas and Caramel you will love this. Simple easy to make with Bananas, Vanilla pudding, Dulce De Leche ( found in the Mexican food section ) and Pound Cake. I don&#39;t know how it happened, but I&#39;ve developed quite a fondness (and following) for my versions of Southern classics like fried chicken, biscuits, and even banana cream pie. This Banana Pudding Trifle is a delicious and easy banana pudding dessert that is loaded with fresh bananas, banana pudding, vanilla wafers and cool whip!
