I made this homemade BBQ chicken pizza last weekend and it was a complete disaster. When I make homemade pizza, I like the cheese extra bubbly and the crust extra crisp. Though store-bought crust is convenient, I suggest using homemade. Bread baked fresh in house daily! With provolone, lettuce, tomatoes &amp; mayo.
