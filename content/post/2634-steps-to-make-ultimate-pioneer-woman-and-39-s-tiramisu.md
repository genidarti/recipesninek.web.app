recipeinstructions:
- "In a saucepan, bring some water to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer | Find a mixing bowl that will fit over the top of the pan, but not sink all the way in. (Do-it-yourself double boiler!)"
- "Put 5 egg yolks into the mixing bowl | Add ¼ cup sugar and whisk for 3 minutes until yolks start to turn a pale yellow | Place the mixing bowl on the saucepan with the simmering water | Slowly add 1/2 cup Marsala Cooking Wine and whisking constantly as you add."
- "Cook over the simmering water, use a rubber spatula to scrape and fold mixture in the bowl | Cook until thick for about 5 minutes | Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool about 30-40 mins."
- "In the Meantime | Place mascarpone cheese in a bowl and stir until smooth | Next put your mixing bowl in the Freezer for 15 minutes, this will help tremendously to form your Whip Cream quickly | Add Heavy Whipping Cream and remaining 4 tablespoons sugar | Whip on High for 3 minutes until soft peaks form."
- "Add to the bowl of whipped cream, the softened mascarpone cheese and the chilled egg yolk mixture | Fold mixture together gently | Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours."
- "Add to a small bowl | Brewed espresso, remaining Marsala Cooking Wine, Pure Vanilla Extract and Rum | Arrange the ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9 x 13 pan. Spoon a small amount of the coffee mixture over each ladyfinger (keep it under 1 tablespoon per cookie and you&#39;ll be fine)"
- "Plop 1/3 of the mascarpone mixture on top and spread it into a layer. Next, sprinkle a thin layer of Cocoa powder. Repeat the process two more times."
- "Cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving | This allows for more moisture to soften the cookies and the whole mixture to meld together | To serve, spoon out helpings onto individual plates."
- "Note: Tiramisu does not last beyond 24 to 36 hours, as everything eventually starts to break down and become soupy."
- "Bon Appétit :)"
