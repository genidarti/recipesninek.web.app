Divide the vegetables between two racks over two baking sheets in a single layer. Gajar matar sabzi is a classic combo vegetable sabzi made especially when the red carrots and fresh peas are in season. Though I meant to post earlier before the winter is over, when the Delhi carrots and peas are available. But last season somehow could not. When potato is half cooked add cauliflower and peas. 

So that is going to wrap this up with this exceptional food baked cauliflower,carrot and peas sabji
