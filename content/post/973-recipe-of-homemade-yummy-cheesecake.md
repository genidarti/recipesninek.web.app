recipeingredient:
- "16 oz 1lb of cream cheese"
- "3 eggs room temp"
- "1 c heavy whipping cream"
- "1 Tbsp lemon juice zest of 1 lemon"
- "8 tbsp sugar"
- "1 tsp vanilla"
- "8 TBSP flour optional"
- "1 lb sour cream"
- "3 tbsp sugar"
- "1 package ground almonds"
- "stick butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 300° and butter a 10 inch spring-form pan"
- "For the crust take the ground almonds and some melted butter (or oil) and make it into a crumble-like texture. Add sugar to taste. This is more of a gauging with your eye sort of thing. You can use regular wheat flour instead too. Flatten the mixture onto the bottom of the pan. I go for a thin crust layer which would just about cover any spots showing on the pan."
- "Separate the eggs and set aside the whites."
- "In a separate bowl whip up the cream cheese until smooth. Beat in the sugar. Mix in the yolks, lemon juice or zest, optional vanilla, whipping cream, optional flour and set aside."
- "In a separate bowl beat up the egg whites into a snow - ie until firm"
- "Fold the snow into the cheese mixture"
- "Pour into the pan and bake for 45 minutes."
- "While the cake is baking mix the sour cream and sugar for the topping."
- "After 45 minutes, remove the cheese mixture from the oven and spread the sour cream very gently over the cake. The cake will still be a bit soft so be careful not to break it"
- "Bake for another 10 min"
- "Don&#39;t worry if the cake is still wobbly"
- "Let it cool and refrigerate overnight or stick in the freezer for quick results. And a strawberry drizzle is awesome to go with this."
- "Enjoy some deliciousness!"
