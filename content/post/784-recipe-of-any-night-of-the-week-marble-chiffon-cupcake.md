- "Line the cupcake tray with paper cups. Then alternately add chocolate and non-chocolate batter into each cup until almost full, leaving about 1 cm from the top."
- "Decorate the top with any marble pattern that you like. I add three dots of different color on top. Then use a toothpick to drag through each dot with one continuous round stroke."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 340째F or 170째C for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean."
