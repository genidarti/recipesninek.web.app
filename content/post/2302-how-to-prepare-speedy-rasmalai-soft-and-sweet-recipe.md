- "1/2 teaspoon Eliachi Powder Cardamon Powder"
- " sugar syrup"
- "2 cup Water"
- "1 cup Sugar"
- "1 teaspoon Rose water or Kewra essence"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil milk in a heavy bottom pan. TIP - Always use full cream milk to make paneer. The fat content in full milk makes the best paneer."
- "When the milk becomes frothy and bubbles start to form on top that&#39;s the time to add vinegar/lemon juice. TIP - Wait for milk to get bubbly before adding the acid. This will result in perfect chenna/paneer."
- "Pour in vinegar/lemon juice."
- "Slowly mix vinegar/lemon juice in the milk and milk will curdle."
- "When the whey/liquid in curdle milk turns to pale green in colour, take the pan off the flame."
- "Meanwhile line a strainer with muslin cloth."
- "Quickly strain paneer. TIP - Letting it sit will result in hard and chewy rasmalai."
- "Wash paneer under cold water to get rid of vinegar/lemon juice taste. TIP - This will wash away all the taste of acid from paneer."
- "Squeeze paneer and allow the water to drain"
- "You can also hang paneer/chenna for 20- 30 minutes until the water stops dripping. TIP - This step is important. If water is not drained well from paneer, rasmalai pieces will start to disintegrate in sugar syrup."
- "Remove paneer from cloth. Paneer should feel crumbly but moist."
- "Start kneading the paneer like a dough."
- "Use your whole palm and fingers to knead paneer. It will take somewhere between 9-10 minutes to knead it into a smooth dough. TIP - Knead paneer with your hands. Have tried kneading it in a food processor but the result was not satisfactory."
- "Take paneer dough in your hand."
- "Squeeze it tight. It should not feel sticky at all. In fact it should feel creamy and roll smoothly in between your palms. TIP - Squeeze and press in between your palms couple of times before rolling it like a ball. This will prevent cracks."
- "Gently press in between your palms and flatten the balls. Set it aside and repeat the process with rest of the paneer."
- "Combine water and sugar in a pan. Add essence of your choice. Bring it a boil."
- "Slowly add flattened paneer pieces to the syrup. Do not overcrowd the pan.TIP - Make sure there is enough room for the paneer balls to expand during boiling. Leave some space for the pieces to float. Reduce the flame to MEDIUM LOW."
- "Slowly the pieces will start to float up."
- "When all the pieces float to the surface.."
- "Cover the pan with the lid and let it simmer for 3-4 minutes on a medium low flame."
- "Flatten paneer pieces will swell in size. Take it off the flame and allow it to cool"
- "When comfortable to touch, take a flattened paneer piece and squeeze out all the syrup. Press gently."
- "When all the syrup is pressed out, paneer pieces will come back to it&#39;s original shape. Set it aside."
- "PREPARING THE SYRUP Onto the final step. Assemble ingredients."
- "In a heavy bottomed pan, add milk and bring it to a boil. Add in sugar, saffron strands and milk powder."
- "Whisk until well blended."
- "Continue boiling at a medium flame stirring continuously. Stir in thinly sliced nuts and mix. Keep stirring and boil the milk for 20-25 minutes. Milk will thicken to a desired consistency - neither to thick nor too liquid-y."
- "Carefully drop in flattened paneer balls."
- "Allow the flatten paneer balls to simmer in hot syrup for 1-2 minutes."
- "Take it off the flame, cover and let the paneer pieces soak in the syrup."
- "Transfer it to a big bowl and allow it to chill. Tastes better when chilled."
