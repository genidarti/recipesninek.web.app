recipeingredient:
- " Pizza dough store bought or homemade we used this recipe httpswwwsugardishmecom10minutepizzadough"
- " Pizza sauce as much or as little as you like we made our own but you can buy some premade in a jar too"
- " torn mozzarella cheese"
- " shredded Italian cheese blend"
- " jalapeo sliced and deseeded leave seeds in for extra heat"
- " Pepperoni slices as much or as little as you like"
- " small handful of fresh basil leaves"
- " Sriracha for drizzling"
- " Honey for drizzling"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F."
- "Start out by making your pizza dough by following the linked recipe to a T. If you are buying pre-made dough, skip this step! (NOTE: we recommend Trader Joes ‚Äúready to bake garlic and herb pizza dough‚Äù if you live near a Trader Joes! Any kind of pizza dough is just fine though.)"
- "While your dough is rising for 10 minutes, pull off chunks of mozzarella from your mozzarella ball until you get about 1 cup‚Äôs worth and place them in a bowl."
- "Next, wash your jalape√±o, pat it dry with paper towel and place it on a cutting board. Cut your jalape√±o into slices and then de-seed them, using a toothpick to poke out the seeds."
- "Remove your fresh basil leaves from the stem and set them aside. Wash and pat them dry if you feel like being sanitary!"
- "Don‚Äôt forget to get out your pepperoni and shredded cheese as well!"
- "After 10-ish minutes have passed, sprinkle some flour down on a clean surface and place your dough ball on the counter. Grab a rolling pin and roll out that dough! (NOTE: We rolled ours out to be about ~1/8-1/4‚Ä≥ thin‚Ä¶ so pretty thin. We found that this was the perfect thickness after it was done. It will rise quite a bit, so don‚Äôt make it too thick!)"
- "Place your dough on a greased pizza stone or cast iron pizza pan. (NOTE: If you don‚Äôt have a pizza stone or pan, use the back side of a sheet pan! Don‚Äôt forget to spray it with non-stick spray. If you need to shape your pizza to be a little more square, go for it!)"
- "Next, season your crust! (NOTE: We recommend basting it with melted butter or olive oil mixed with garlic powder and Italian seasoning. If you‚Äôre using freshly-pressed garlic cloves, don‚Äôt overdo it because it has a strong flavor!)"
- "Now start spooning your pizza sauce onto the dough and spread it around. Add as much or as little as you like."
- "Then add your shredded Italian cheese blend, evenly distributing"
- "Add the pepperoni next. Again, add as much or as little as you like. Then add the jalape√±o slices, then the mozzarella chunks and then finally the basil leaves."
- "Place your pizza in the oven and set the timer for 10 minutes."
- "After 10 minutes, Take your pizza out and see if it‚Äôs cooked to your liking. We ended up putting ours back in for 2 more minutes!"
- "When you‚Äôre happy with your pizza‚Äôs done-ness, finish it off with a drizzle of Sriracha across the top, followed by a drizzle of honey."
- "Enjoy!! üôÇ"
