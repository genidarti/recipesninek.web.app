recipeingredient:
- "1 Ripe bananas"
- "1 tsp Lemon juice"
- "50 grams Unsalted butter"
- "40 grams Condensed milk"
- "20 grams Maple syrup"
- "1 Egg"
- "60 grams Cake flour"
- "12 grams  Skimmed milk powder"
- "8 grams  Cornstarch"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- "1 for decoration Nuts of your preference eg walnuts optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add butter to a bowl and warm to room temperature. Let the egg and condensed milk also warm to room temperature. Sift the dry ingredients marked ※."
- "Peel the banana, getting rid of any stringy bits, and make sure you have 120 g. Break the banana into smaller pieces and mash with a fork until puréed. Add lemon juice."
- "Cream the butter with a whisk and add condensed milk, maple syrup and a well beaten egg a little at a time (and in that order), mixing after each addition."
- "Preheat the oven to 180°C. Add the banana purée to the mixture from Step 3. There are a lot of liquid ingredients compared to the butter, so it will probably separate a little, if that happens add 1/5 of the dry ingredients marked ◎ and stir quickly with a whisk."
- "Sift the rest of the dry ingredients marked ◎ into the mixture and fold in with a rubber spatula. (This will completely prevent the mixture from separating, so you can breathe a sigh of relief!)"
- "Pour the batter into the muffin cups until each is roughly 80% full and decorate with toppings if you like. Once the oven is preheated, bake the muffins for 20-30 minutes."
- "When the surface of the cupcakes is golden brown take them out and test with a skewer to see if they&#39;re done. If you insert the skewer into the cake and the batter is cooked through, they&#39;re done. Cool on a rack and you&#39;re done."
- "[Bonus 1] The cupcakes in the main photo are topped with walnuts, hazelnuts and pistachio. They taste great without as well, so feel free to decorate how you like."
- "[Bonus 2] If you brush rum or other liquor on top whilst the cupcakes are still hot, they&#39;ll impart a subtle, mature taste."
- "[Bonus 3] These were made with chocolate chips."
- "[Bonus 4] I wrapped the finished cupcakes with cling film and then stuck the sticker from the banana."

But put &#39;moist&#39; in the context of a delicious dessert, and all of that might be forgotten. Word aversion is a funny thing. The band is led by singer David Usher. Other members of the band are Mark Makoway (guitars), Francis Fillion (drums), Louis Lalancette (bass), Jonathan Gallivan (guitars) and Kevin Young (keyboards). The bread was so moist and flavorful, but I have yet to find anything that comes close.
