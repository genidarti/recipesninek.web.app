Now that summer is finally approaching I&#39;m wondering. Keywords: baked spaghetti squash, instant pot beef ragu, recipes with spaghetti. When the carrots are nice and tender — I don&#39;t think al dente does the carrot any favors — you add in some (organic) ground beef, which you crumble in the pan and mix in with the carrots, adding the green part of the spring onions while you&#39;re at it. This I finish with a squeeze of lemon or lime juice for.
