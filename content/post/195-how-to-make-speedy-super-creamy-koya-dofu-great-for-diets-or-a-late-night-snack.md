recipeingredient:
- " Amounts are approximate"
- "80 ml White wine"
- "20 ml Soy sauce"
- "400 ml Soy milk"
- "15 grams Butter"
- "45 grams Koya dofu diced"
- "1 Black pepper preferably not coarsely ground"
- "1 pinch Salt as a finishing touch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a frying pan over high heat, then add the white wine. Let the alcohol evaporate, reduce to the lowest heat, then add the butter, soy milk, and koya dofu."
- "The mixture may at first appear to separate, but it will immediately come together. Simmer over the lowest heat for 10 minutes without boiling. The koya dofu should become rehydrated."
- "Skin will form on the surface, so stir occasionally. Once the koya dofu rehydrates, add the soy sauce into the soy milk mixture, then mix until the color is uniform."
- "Transfer to a plate, and sprinkle with a generous amount of  black pepper to accentuate the creaminess."
- "Seasoning it with a pinch of salt will further enhance the creaminess and make it a great drinking appetizer with wine. Add umami seasoning to boost the flavor to taste."
- "This dish is great for diets. It&#39;s nice and chewy! This dish is just as filling as a main dish! Try it for lunch or dinner (with nutritional supplements) while dieting, or else as a late-night or in-between meal snack, or drinking appetizer."
- "To achieve the best texture, before cooking, soak the koya dofu in hot water for about 4 minutes to rehydrate, and squeeze out the excess moisture! I use it without soaking it first."
