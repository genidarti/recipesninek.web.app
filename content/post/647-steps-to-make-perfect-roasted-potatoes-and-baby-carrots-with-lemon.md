These Baby Red Potatoes are roasted to perfection - crisp on the outside and tender outside. This recipe delivers lemon-flavored roasted potatoes to your table, making a great side dish for Greek dishes such as souvlaki. Just like the potatoes at my favourite restaurant. Don&#39;t change anything. if you omit the lemons and oregano, like some suggested, then your not making Greek style Lemon. Roast a combination of carrots and potatoes for a simple holiday side dish.
