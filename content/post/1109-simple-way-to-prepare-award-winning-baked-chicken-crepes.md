Saute for another 5 minutes or until the leek is fragrant and the mushrooms are tender.  Add the garlic gloves and the thyme and saute for another 2 minutes."
- "Add half the cream (100ml) and the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, add the shredded chicken, season with salt and pepper and cook, for about 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and add the dill."
- "Preheat oven to 200C fan-forced. Place 1 crepe on a flat surface. Top with 1/4 of the filling and roll up to enclose. Place in a fitting baking dish and repeat with the remaining crepes and filling."
- "Drizzle the rest of the cream over the crepes and sprinkle the grated cheese and the parsley on top. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Enjoy!"
