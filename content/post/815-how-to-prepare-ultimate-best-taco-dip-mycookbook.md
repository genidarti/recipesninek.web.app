recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, sour cream, and taco seasoning with a hand mixer utnil the dip is combined and creamy."
- "If there are small clumps, then the cream cheese isn’t soft enough. Just let it sit longer so the cream cheese can soften again and mix again."
- "Once it is mixed, pour into a serving platter. Top with shredded cheese, then shredded lettuce, and finally diced tomatoes. Serve with tortilla chips."
- "Notes- make a day ahead of time. wrap it up.and refrigerate it dont put lettuce or tomato on, wait until ready to sever it.
