recipeinstructions:
- "First, to make the creme patisierre."
- "Beat the egg yolks and sugar for 1 minute at high speed."
- "Add the flour and beat on high speed for a further 2 minutes. Set aside."
- "Pour milk in a heavy-based saucepan adding in the chopped up vanilla beans. bring this to just below the boil."
- "Remove the vanilla bean bits and, whisking vigourously while pouring, pour the milk into the egg mixture and continue whisking fast for 1 minute."
- "Return this mixture to the saucepan back on a medium heat and stir continuously until the mixture thickens. about 2 or so minutes."
- "Pour into a bowl and cover with gladwrap (ceram wrap), making sure the wrap lays across the the top of the patisierre to stop a film from forming."
- "Cool completely on the bench."
- "When cool, stir in the Lemon Curd and the Passionfruit Pulp (I include the seeds as I like the texture change in the Pav, but you can seive these out if you wish)."
- "Place the Pastisierre into a ziplock plastic bag, remove as much air as you can, zip it up and keep at room tempetature while you prepare the Pav. (If you don&#39;t want to make the Pav right away, the patissierre will stay ok in the bag in the cupboard for at least 3 - 4 days)"

- "Place baking paper on an oven tray and draw a 25cm circle."
- "Scoop out half of the Pav mixture onto the tray and then put the creme patisierre made earlier into a piping bag (or snip the end of the ziplock bag and use that) and pipe swirls of the patisierre onto the Pav, avoiding the very edges. Then scoop on top the remaining Pav mixture. Using a spatula, shape out a circle leaving about a 1cm gap to the edge of the drawn circle."
- "Smooth the top of the Pav and then put in the oven and immediately turn down the heat to 215째F."
- "Bake Pavlova for 1 hour and 15 minutes then TURN OVEN OFF AND LEAVE PAV IN THERE WITH DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN TO COOL COMPLETELY"
- "Carefully lift Pav onto a serving plate or platter and top with whipped cream that has the Limoncello and the remaining patisierre folded through it."
- "Place Raspberries on top of cream and drizzle the Passionfruit pulp over the top."
- "Done! enjoy!!"
