recipeingredient:
- "2 cups allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 tsp baking powder"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "3 tbsp melted butter"
- "2 medium eggs"
- "3/4 cup whole milk or equal parts evaporated milk and water"
- "1/4 cup vegetable oil"
- "2 large apples"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, peel and core the apples, then cube them. Transfer to a bowl and add in the cinnamon and mix thoroughly till all the apple cubes are coated in cinnamon."
- "Next, mix together all the dry ingredients in a separate large mixing bowl. In another bowl or measuring cup, mix together all the wet ingredients and whisk thoroughly to combine."
- "Then in the bowl of the dry ingredients, add in the wet ingredients and mix with a spatula just until well combined, making sure there are no lumps. After, fold in the apples just until well incorporated."
- "Let the muffin batter rest for a while but in the meantime, grease a muffin pan with butter, I like to grease the entire pan, so when the muffins puff up, they don&#39;t stick to the edges of the pan. Pre heat your oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit for about 7 - 10 minutes to get the oven hot enough."
- "While you wait for your oven to preheat, fill your muffin pan with the muffin batter."
- "Bake the muffins in the preheated oven on the middle rack for about 30 minutes, till a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the muffins brown. Baking time may vary. Let cool for about 5 minutes in the pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely or enjoy them warm. This muffin batter keeps well in the fridge for up to 3 days, baking instructions stay the same."
- "If making a mug cake, pour in a medium sized mug about 5 heaped tbsp of the muffin batter and microwave for about 1 minute 30 secs, if a toothpick inserted doesn&#39;t come out clean, microwave another 30 seconds but using 10 second intervals just in case they cook faster. Over microwaving will cause your muffin to be rubbery. Happy baking!"
