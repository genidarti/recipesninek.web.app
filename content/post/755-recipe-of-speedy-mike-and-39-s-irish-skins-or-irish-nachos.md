recipeinstructions:
- "All items you&#39;ll need are pictured here except for potatoes and bacon."
- "Fry [don&#39;t burn] bacon until crispy and set grease and bacon to the side to cool separately from one another. You&#39;ll need this grease to liberally coat your potatoes later.                                                Authors Note: It&#39;s always a good idea to save your un-burnt bacon grease in the fridge in a sealed jar. It lasts forever and can be used in just about any dish as a grease and a flavor enhancer."
- "Boil chicken and everything else in the Shreadded Meat section on high for about 30 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked. Poke a hole in the center of your thickest breast. If the fluid runs clear, your chicken is cooked. If not, boil longer."
- "IMPORTANT STEP:                                       After chicken is slightly cooled, fine shread chicken with fingers and add 4 + additional tablespoons Sriracha, one healthy splash of Guiness beer [about 1/8 cup or 2 tablespoons or more. you&#39;ll want your chicken juicy! ] and 1/2 cup lightly packed, fresh chopped Cilantro leaves, no stems. Hand mix, cover tightly and sit to the side. Don&#39;t refrigerate."
- "Poke a hole with a knife through the center of your raw potatoes. Coat each potato generously with bacon grease, sprinkle lightly with sea salt and wrap spuds tightly in tinfoil. Bake at °425 for 40-45 minutes or until potatoes are fully baked.                                           Authors Note: Place a cookie sheet or a sheet of tinfoil underneath your potatoes while baking. These will leak some bacon grease through the tinfoil wrap and cause your oven to smoke a bit."
- "Once cooled, cut potatoes in half and gently scoop out the centers leaving about 1/4&#34; of the outer shells in tact. Spray the whites of your potatoes with butter flavored spray and sprinkle them lightly with black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.                                          Save potato center remainders for a thickener in other dishes, hash browns or mashed potatoes. Or, you can discard them."
- "Place empty potatoes skins back in the oven for 10+ minutes at °425 or, until they firm up, dry out slightly and lightly brown. Pull skins out and turn oven down to °350."
- "Add some of your shreadded chicken to the base of your shells. Then add any of the items from the Toppers Section any way you&#39;d like."
- "Place stacked potato skins back in oven at °350 and bake until cheeses are fully melted. About 25 minutes.                                Don&#39;t worry about your veggies not fully cooking in the oven. You&#39;ll want them just slightly on the crispy side.                            Have your guests top their Irish Skins with additional fresh garnishments, salsas, sour cream, Sriracha and sea salt."
- "Serve with ice cold Guiness Stout beers in chilled glasses. Pour 3/4 of the way up in your glasses and let beers settle for about 2 minutes before drinking. Enjoy!"
- "TO MAKE IRISH NACHOS:                            Slice potatoes in 1/4&#34; thick rounds, season as directed and deep fry in oil until they&#39;re soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. Grease a cast iron skillet and place a layer of fried potatoes on the bottom. Add shreadded Sriracha Chicken with a few cheese and onion toppers and add one more layer of fried potatoes. Then, pile on all of your toppers and place in a °350 oven for 25+ minutes. Bake until cheeses are fully melted and visable spuds are browned."
