recipeingredient:
- "1 lb White Meat Chicken Although you can use either"
- "1 tbsp Minced Garlic or Garlic Powder"

- "1/2 cup Olive Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start with prepping your peppers. For those of y&#39;all who follow my recipes you know I like to julienne my veggies. You can slice and use any color bell pepper, but I would stick to bell peppers rather than changing the veg. If you do, please comment I would like to know how it turned out."
- "On a clean cutting board. Cut your chicken into bite size pieces. I usually go for half an inch. After cutting chicken coat with cajun seasoning. We will save the other seasonings for the sauce. Leave chicken in fridge for hour minimum, 24 hours max."
- "Start with boiling water for pasta. Use any kind of pasta. We like to use veggie pasta for healtier balance. When the water is ready throw in pasta, and heat oil in skillet or wok."
- "When oil is hot, toss in chicken and cook till you see no raw outside pieces. Chicken will finish cooking with the veggies. Toss in veggies and cook till veggies are bendable, but still crunchy. The veggies will finish cooking in the sauce."
- "Toss in heavy cream and the rest of your seasonings. Bring cream to a simmer, and toss in parmesan cheese. Please be smart and get some parmesan you have to grate. Kraft is not cheese. Try to find a 12-24 month aged cheese. You will thank me for it. This dish doesn&#39;t require salt since you have such a salty cheese. You can add ground pepper if you like."
- "Cook until sauce thickens just a little. You&#39;re not looking for a heavy looking sauce. Drain pasta and plate adding sauce to your liking. My wife drowns her noodles with sauce. Add some extra grated parmesan, and serve with some tasty french bread."
