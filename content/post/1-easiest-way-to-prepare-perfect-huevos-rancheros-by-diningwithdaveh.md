- "2 can chopped tomatoes"
- "1 1/4 bunch fresh coriander"
- "4 tortillas"
- "1 cup grated cheese"
- " tabasco sauce"
- "1 lime"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop onions, peppers, chillis, garlic and mushrooms (you can add or subtract chillis as required, or even change types, but I&#39;d recommend using at least one). Slice lime into quarters and place in the fridge"
- "Add 2 or 3 decent chugs of olive oil to a large wok and put on high heat"
- "Add chopped onion, peppers, chillis, garlic and mushrooms, then stir fry on mid to high heat for 10 mins to caramelise"

- "As quickly as possible, crack all 4 eggs into their respective pockets (this is to ensure that all of the eggs receive similar cooking times)"
- "Cover pan with large lid and cook on low to mid heat for 3 mins (this gives you perfect runny eggs -add more time as required for desired consistency)"
- "Remove lid and sprinkle fresh chopped coriander across the top"
- "Serve to warmed plates immediately (alternatively, you can bring the pan to the table and serve into warmed tortillas with a sprinkle of grated cheese). Add squeeze of lime juice and dash of Tabasco sauce to taste"
