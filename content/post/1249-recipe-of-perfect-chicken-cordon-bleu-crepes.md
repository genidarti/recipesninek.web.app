Served with an incredible Dijon cream sauce. Chicken stuffed with ham and cheese, coated with crunchy golden breadcrumbs. You&#39;d swear it&#39;s fried - but it&#39;s baked. Some say this chicken cordon bleu recipe originated outside of France, but it is certainly eaten a lot in France and it has a French name, so we&#39;ll consider it French. The recipe here is for a baked chicken cordon bleu, which is perhaps a bit healthier and easier then frying the breaded chicken and ham.
