Pastalaya is another one of those dishes that gets some folks kinda cranked up. Pastalaya is simply taking the basic combination of the flavors of a typical jambalaya, but in a pasta dish instead of a rice dish. Variation: Mix and match the protein by using chopped cooked pork or cooked crawfish tails. We use Italian herby sausages, classic pork sausages and more. Prepare your dough beforehand to make this easy Brooklyn-style smoky sausage and crispy kale pizza.
