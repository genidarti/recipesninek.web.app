Chicken, bacon and avocado come together in this delicious chopped salad, topped with a garlicky vinaigrette. This Chicken, Bacon and Avocado Chopped Salad is packed with some of my favorite savory flavors, tossed with a simple red wine vinaigrette, and tastes so fresh and delicious! Season the chicken lightly with salt and immediately place in the same pan; cook (medium heat) for Peel, pit the avocado; add to the same bowl, along with the cumin, a pinch each of the salt and Who doesn&#39;t love bacon-wrapped shrimp? Try this variation on that theme by putting crispy bacon inside.
