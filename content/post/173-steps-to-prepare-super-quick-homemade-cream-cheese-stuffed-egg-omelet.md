- "Oil pan and heat until very hot. Once hot, turn down to low and pour eggs into pan."
- "Let one side com entirely, then try your best to flip the flat egg so the other side can cook (it&#39;s surly hard to flip because the top will still be raw and wet but it is possible to flip it)."

- "Fold omelet in half and let sit in pan for 30 seconds or a minute)."
- "Serve with hashbrowns (which should be cooked in the same pan as the eggs BEFORE the eggs are cooked to ensure the pan is hot enough, this may add an additional 15 minutes to preparation time) Also serve with fruit because fruit is tasty and healthy! Pears are suggested."
