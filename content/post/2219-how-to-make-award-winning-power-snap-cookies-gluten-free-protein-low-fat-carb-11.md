recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup splenda"
- "1/2 cup Greek Yogurt Nonfat 70 cals"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "2 egg whites 50 cals"
- "3/4 cup soy protein isolate powder 225 cals"
- "1/4 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon"
- "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg"
- "Pinch salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yogurt, Splenda, egg whites, vanilla in a bowl until well combined. One revision that works is replacing the Yogurt with simply water. (Decrease amount to 6 Tablespoons, cookie and mixture will be a bit more foamy in texture)"
- "In another larger bowl mix protein powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Gradually mix in liquids."
- "The protein powder will make it a bit hard to mix well. After mixed, put in refrig covered for 30 min to make it easier to handle (optional)"
- "Preheat oven to 375"
- "Shape dough into walnut sized balls and placed on a untreated baking sheet. Press cookie ball with bottom of a glass to flatten, they should become about a 1.5 inch parameter and 1/4 inch thick.. Little thin is okay. they do not spread much when baking"
- "Bake for 10-12 minutes or until light brown. If you used yogurt, they will be chewy, if you used water, they will be a bit more tender and foamy. Longer they sit out, the harder they become. After a day or two, they harden to the point of something resembling a ginger snap. I&#39;m going to attempt higher baking temp/time in the future maybe speed this process up."
- "Should make about 14 cookies.. They are a total of little under 400 calories for all of them.. Mostly protein. (Water modification will make this 300 with near zero carbs)"
