recipeingredient:
- "1 Glass Rajma"
- "5 tomato pureed"
- "2 big Chopped Onions"
- "1 tbsp Ginger Garlic Paste"
- "2 Cloves"
- "1 Tej patta"
- "1 Black cardamon"
- "as required Rajma Masala"
- "Pinch Hing"
- "1 tsp Jeera"
- "to taste Salt"
- "1/2 tsp Haldi powder"
- "as per taste Red Chilli powder"
- "Few Chopped green chillies"
- "as required Garam Masala"
- "1 Lemon juice optional"
- "as required Coriander leaves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and Soak the Rajma in some water for at least an hour or till you prepare the masala. I have used the dark red ones which take even longer to cook and are traditionally soaked overnight so it is easier to cook them. However, if you do have the time go ahead and soak them overnight."
- "Heat oil in a pan add the Cumin seeds, jeera, chopped Onions and Green Chillies and sauté. I have not chopped the onions finely as will make a puree later. Once the Onion starts to brown add the Tomatoes puree and Ginger Garlic paste and cook till it all becomes mushy."
- "Let this mixture cool a little before you puree it else your grinder would burst because of the heat."
- "In the same pan add this Puree and let it cook for 7 – 10 minutes or till the oil separates."
- "Add the Cumin, Coriander, Red Chilli, Rajma masala, Garam masala powders, Salt and cook for a further 5 minutes. Once you start getting a faint aroma of the masalas add the Rajma (without the water) and sauté for another 7 – 8 minutes till the masala becomes really dry."
- "I cooked the Rajma for on a medium flame till they were soft and completely in tune with the masala that they were coated in. It took me around 15 – 18 whistles. Sprinkle the fresh Coriander on top."
