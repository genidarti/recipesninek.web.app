recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Butter and line with parchment a 20cm round tin. Grate the carrots – to get 200g you need to grate about 3 medium sized ones. Mix the flour with baking powder and the spices and put aside. Mix the sugar with the oil in a bowl of a standing mixer (or use a hand mixer), then beat in the eggs. Add the grated carrots, the raisins, sieve in the flour and spice mix and fold it all in with a spatula. Pour into the tin and bake for about 50 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool the cake in the tin."
- "When completely cold, slice it across in two layers with a large bread knife. Spread apricot jam over the bottom half in a generous layer. Cover with the top half."
- "Prepare the ganache: break up the chocolate into pieces as small as possible. Put the cream in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Immediately add the chocolate and leave to stand (in the microwave) for a minute or two. Whisk together into smooth ganache."
- "Using a spoon, drizzle over the top of the cake, letting the ganache dribble over the sides as well. Serve with cream! clotted cream! custard! whipped cream! warm vanilla sauce! caramel sauce! And it’s lovely on its own, too."
