- "Spoon the batter into the chilled mould tin (fill to 80% full). Bake on the top rack of a preheated oven to 200°C for 8 -10 minutes."
- "After they&#39;re cooled, remove from the mold carefully. They&#39;re good to eat immediately, but even better the next day."
- "On 23/11/2008 I changed the amount of plain flour 120 g to 100 g of plain flour + 20 g of ground almond to create a moister texture."
