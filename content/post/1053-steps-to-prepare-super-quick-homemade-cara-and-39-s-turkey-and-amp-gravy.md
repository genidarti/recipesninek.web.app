recipeingredient:
- "2-3 cups shredded cooked turkey"
- "1/2 C chopped carrots"
- "1/2 C chopped celery"
- " For Gravy"
- "1/2 stick butter 14c"
- "1/2 C flour"
- "4 C water plus a little extra in case"
- "2 pks or cubes chicken bullion"
- " OR 4 Cups Chicken Turkey broth then omit water seasoning"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop veggies, if you choose to add them.* This step can be skipped if you prefer just meat &amp; gravy.* These need to be boiled in a large pot. Everything will go in this pot, eventually."
- "While veggies boil, shredded the turkey into bite size or desirable pieces. I used wings, legs &amp; breast to have a mixture. I kept checking the veggies with a fork. You don&#39;t want them too mushy. I lightly seasoned the turkey."
- "Once the veggies seem easy to puncture, remove from pot. Add the butter &amp; flour, on medium-high heat stirring frequently"
- "After 5-7min of stirring &amp; letting the flour cook, add water/seasoning OR broth. Continue stirring to make sure there aren&#39;t any lumps. The heat can be lowered to medium once it thickens. Add veggies &amp; cook about 10min"
- "Lastly, add turkey. Stir &amp; fold in well. This will need to cook about 15-20min. During this time you can decide if more seasonings are needed, more water or whatever. For a side, obviously I made rice, but potatoes or stuffing would be delicious as well! Enjoy!"
