recipeingredient:
- "80 g spaghetti or spaghettini I used Gragnano pasta"
- "1 knob butter"
- "2 tbsp grey mullet bottarga"
- "1/2 lime"
- "4 walnut halves chopped"
- " Black pepper"
- " Salt"
- "1 pot of truffle pesto optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil a kettle and add boiling water to a pot on medium-high heat. Salt the water as preferred (I use half a tablespoon of salt for a medium pot) then add the pasta and cook as per instructions. You want to drain it while it&#39;s still al dente so remove from heat 2 minutes before the recommended cooking time. I used Gragnano pasta in the &#34;spaghettini&#34; cut, which cooks in 8 mins so I removed it from the heat after 6 mins and removed the excess water using a sieve (you can use a colander as well)."
- "While the pasta is cooking, heat up the knob of butter in a pan and add the chopped walnuts once it&#39;s hot. Toast them until they become golden brown, then add the drained pasta. Stir well."
- "Add the juice of half a lime and grind some black pepper on top (to taste). Add the bottarga and stir well for a minute or so."
- "Spoon some truffle pesto on a serving plate and place the pasta on it. Top with some more bottarga and walnuts. Serve hot - no one likes limp pasta!!"
