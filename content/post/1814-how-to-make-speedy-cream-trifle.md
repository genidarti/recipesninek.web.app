Chocolate is my mom&#39;s love language… haha just kidding… but seriously, this woman LOVES chocolate. Trifle is a dessert found in English and other cuisines. Made with fruit, a thin layer of sponge fingers commonly soaked in sherry or another fortified wine, and custard, the contents of a trifle are highly variable; many varieties exist, some forgoing fruit entirely and instead using other ingredients.
