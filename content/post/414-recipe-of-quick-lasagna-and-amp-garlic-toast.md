From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin *lasania, from Latin lasanum (&#34;cooking pot&#34;), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, &#34;trivet or stand for a pot&#34;). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, &#34;almond cake&#34;). Lasagna has many versions, both within Italy and around the world, but when we talk about &#34;real&#34; lasagna in Italy we mean &#34;Lasagna alla Bolognese&#34; i.e., from Bologna in the region of Emilia-Romagna.
