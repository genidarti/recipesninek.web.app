recipeingredient:
- "1 gallon full cream milk"
- "2 tbsp Vinegardiluted or Lime juice diluted"
- "1 large cheesecloth  muslin cloth"
- "4 cup cane sugar"
- "8 cup water"
- "1/4 tsp cardomom crushed"
- "1 tbsp pistachios crushed"
- "1 tsp rose water"
- "1/4 tsp saffron strands"
recipeinstructions:
- "On a medium heat, bring the milk to a rolling boil, while stirring constantly, so as not to let any of the milk solids stick to the bottom of the vessel. Once it comes to the boil, take the vessel off the heat."
- "IMPORTANT: Let the milk cool down for a couple of minutes. If available, you can even add a couple of ice cubes to bring the temperature down a notch."
- "While the milk is still hot, add the acid (vinegar or lime juice) steadily, while stirring continuously, but not vigorously."
- "Continue stirring the milk until all the milk solids (cheese curds) separate from the whey. Do not leave the separated cheese curds in the hot whey for too long, that tends to harden the cheese."
- "Strain the cheese into a colander lined with the muslin cloth, while collecting the whey into a vessel below. The whey is very nutritious, and can be used instead of water while making rotis or chapatis (Indian flat bread)"
- "Wash the cheese curds under running cold water. This serves to cool the cheese down, and to wash the acidic flavors and smell from the cheese."
- "Squeeze the cheese gently to remove much of the water from it. Then, hang the muslin cloth in a warm place for about 30 min, so that some more of the moisture may drip from the cheese."
- "Take the cheese out of the muslin cloth onto a clean, smooth work surface. Knead the cheese for about 7-8 minutes. The way to knead the cheese is to rub the cheese between the base of the Palm or wrist, and the work surface in one long motion, smearing the cheese on the surface."
- "It is important to knead the cheese this way, this helps in getting rid of the grains in the cheese, and makes it spongy."
- "Make golf ball sized dumplings out of the cheese, and roll them between 2 palms until the balls become smooth, and have no wrinkles or cracks.  There should be enough cheese for 20-25 balls."
- "Keep all the balls aside on a plate and cover with a damp cloth."
- "Take  2 cups of the sugar, and about 5 cups of water in a deep vessel. Bring to a boil, and continue to boil the syrup for about 5 minutes."
- "Take a drop of the syrup between the thumb and index finger, and touch the fingertips to each other. When you separate the fingertips, you should see a string of sugar connecting the fingertips. This is called a single thread syrup."
- "Add the cardamom powder to the syrup at this point."
- "Add the cheese balls to the syrup, and cook covered with a tight lid, for about 5-8 minutes, no more. The cheese balls will double in size, so take care not to crowd the vessel."
- "Prepare a syrup out of the remaining sugar and water. There is no need to make a single thread syrup this time. Also add the rose water."
- "Transfer the cheese balls to the fresh syrup. Let the dish naturally cool. Don&#39;t shock the dish by refrigeration."
- "Garnish with the pistachios, and the saffron strands."
- "Leave the rasgullas in the syrup overnight."
- "Serving Tip: serve chilled with a little bit of the syrup. The rasgullas should come out really spongy. Enjoy!"
