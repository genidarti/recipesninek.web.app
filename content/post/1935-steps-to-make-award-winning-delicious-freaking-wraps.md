With restaurants shut and travel restrictions slapped across dozens of cities, families were left with little to do but experiment in the kitchen. We think beeswax wrap is the greatest thing since sliced bread and your food deserves butter than being packaged in plastic! 😂🍞 Beeswax Food Wraps are strong but malleable and mold to These delicious, vegan baked goods came from one of our favorite stands at the Union Square Greenmarket. While the wraps themselves are delicious, the fillings are where it&#39;s at. We went with hummus and our beloved Green Curry paste for sauce and plenty of fresh vegetables. Red bell pepper, carrots, creamy avocado, crispy kale, and cilantro are packed in tight and marry well with the hummus and green curry.
