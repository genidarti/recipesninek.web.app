- "2 tbsp Corn Starch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep your cut of venison by cutting into 1 inch pieces (we processed our own deer and did this before we froze our meat to make prep easier)******************************************I marinated mine for about 6 hours, ((1/2 cup Brown Sugar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce, Cayenne pepper, Paprika, Garlic salt, Onion powder.)) This part is optional, by the way!!**************************"
- "In a large sauce pan heat your oil of choice over medium heat, throw in your venison and cook on all sides, until light brown (5-6 mins) **** Do not cook too long or your meat will be chewy and hard to eat!*********************************** Also, at this point you could add in some onions &amp; bell peppers if you wish. I have picky eaters and I can&#39;t add either of those amazing ingredients!"
- "Once meat is browned, pour in beef broth &amp; 2 cups of water, Bring to a rolling boil. **************************** (I use low sodium broth, you can put more salt in you can&#39;t take salt out!!)"
- "Once boiling turn heat to low, cover and let simmer for 2 hours (yes, you need to stir every so often to keep from burning to the bottomðŸ˜‰)"
- "After your 2 hours is up, mix your corn starch in with 1/2 cup COLD water."
- "Slowly add your corn starch mix into your broth stirring the whole time, let boil for 5 minutes. Turn off heat."
- "If your gravy isn&#39;t thick enough for your liking you can try adding more corn starch mixture (1 tbsp CornStarch &amp; 1/4 cold water cup at a time, make sure heat is on when doing so!)"
- "Serve over Egg noodles, Mashed Potatoes or rice."
