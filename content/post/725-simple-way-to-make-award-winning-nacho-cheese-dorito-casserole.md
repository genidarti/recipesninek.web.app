Casserole: Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dishes. Doritos: I use the Nacho Cheese variety, but feel free to experiment with your favorite. I like to keep them in relatively large chunks too so you&#39;ll have Cheese: A generous mound of shredded cheese on top makes this Dorito bake a proper casserole, and I like to use a combination of Monterey jack. This Dorito chicken casserole is a simple and flavorful meal with a crunchy cheese and Dorito chip topping and crust. When it comes to Doritos—or similar corn chips—there are many flavors to choose from, including ranch flavored and spicy nacho cheese.
