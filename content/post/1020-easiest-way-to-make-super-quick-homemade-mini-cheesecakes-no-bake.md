recipeingredient:
- " Crust"
- "1 package (9 sheets) graham crackers"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter melted"
- "1 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- " Cheesecake Filling"
- "1/2 cup heavy cream"
- "2 packages (8 oz.) each block style cream cheese at room temp"
- "1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk"
- "2 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1 tsp. fresh lemon juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line a 12 count standard size muffin tin with cupcake liners and lightly mist them with non-stick cooking spray. Set this aside."
- "In a food processor, pulse the graham crackers until you have fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs out into a bowl and stir in the sugar and melted butter. It should then resemble wet sand."
- "Place about 2 scant tablespoons of the crumb mixture into each cupcake liner. Use either your fingers or the bottom of a measuring cup to pack down the crumbs into each liner. Set this aside to make the filling."
- "Using a stand mixer (or a hand mixer) fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream on high speed until it is whipped and fluffy. Remove it to a seperate bowl and set it aside."
- "Switch to the paddle attachment and beat the 2 blocks of cream cheese on medium speed until they are smooth and creamy. Then add in the sweetened condensed milk, granulated sugar, lemon juice and vanilla extract. Once it&#39;s all combined, add in the whipped cream. Once the whipped cream is in, mix on low speed until just combined."
- "Next scoop the filling evenly into each liner on top of the crusts. I like to just place the mixture in a large Ziploc bag and pipe it in, but you could just use a spoon also."
- "Place the muffin tin into the freezer for 15 minutes, to give it a bit of a head start to set. Then, cover with plastic wrap and place into the fridge for at least 6 hours."
- "When you&#39;re ready to serve, just carefully remove the liners (if they stick, then pop them into the freezer for just a few minutes, then try again to remove the liner), top with whatever toppings sound good if you want (they&#39;re good with or without toppings) and enjoy!"
