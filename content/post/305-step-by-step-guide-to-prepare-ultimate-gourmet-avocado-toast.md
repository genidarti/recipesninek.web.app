- "1 Large Ripe Avocado"

- " Crumbled Feta Cheese"
- "Leaves Fresh Arugula"
- "1 Squeeze Fresh Lime Juice"
- "1 Light Drizzle of Olive Oil"
- " Red Chili Flakes"
- " Coarse Rock Salt OR Himalayan Pink Salt"
- " Coarsely Ground Black Pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare your Avocado by slicing it in half lengthwise running your knife into the top narrow half and then circling it all around the pit. Twist the two halves of the avocado to separate it and then remove the pit by giving it a firm whack with your knife blade and then twisting it out."
- "Dice the avocado by running your knife lengthwise down the flesh so that the tip of your knife just touches the skin at the bottom. Make vertical cuts about a cm apart and then make horizontal cuts across also about a cm. Use a spoon to scoop out the diced avocado."
- "Toast your sourdough bread using either a toaster or my favourite method: under a broiler. You&#39;ll have to be more careful when it&#39;s under the broiler since it can burn very quickly but the result is a nice crispy crust on top while the rest of the slice remains chewy."
- "Place the diced avocado evenly over the toast pieces and press down gently just so they cling to the bread a little bit. Top with crumbled feta, a squeeze of lime juice, a sprinkle of coarse salt, black pepper, chili flakes, and arugula leaves."
