recipeingredient:
- "1 roughly 12 oz bag of spinach for salad"
- "6 strawberries hulled and cut into quarters or sixths depending on their size see notes above for substitutions"
- "1/8-1/4 red or white onion cut into very thin slices later in the year the onions tend to be stronger and hotter"
- " optional cubed avocado and toasted almonds walnuts or pecans"
- " For the dressing"
- "3-4 Tablespoons light soy sauce start at 3"
- "2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 Tablespoons distilled white vinegar"
- "3-3.5 Tablespoons sugar depending on how sweet you like the dressing Honey and agave nectar are good substitutes"
- "2 Tablespoons minced shallots onion is fine in a pinch"
- "1 Tablespoons water"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "3 Tablespoons vegetable or light olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all dressing ingredients except oil in a bowl and stir or whisk until all sugar is completely dissolved."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning before whisking in oil. If too salty (different soy sauce brands vary in saltiness), try adding a teaspoon of water. Too sweet? Try adding just a dash more soy sauce and Worcestershire. As a general rule, I adjust seasoning before adding the oil because the oil coats the tongue and makes it hard to taste the underlying flavors."
- "Whisk in oil."
- "Arrange salad veg/fruit on platter and serve dressing on the side. If you&#39;re planning to dress the salad before serving, do so immediately before serving as spinach wilts easily."
- "Enjoy! :)"
