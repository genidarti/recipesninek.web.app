recipeinstructions:
- "Start by stirring your oats into your milk in a large bowl and letting it sit for 1 hour to allow them time to soak."
- "Once the oats have soaked for at least 1 hour, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a muffin pan with liners or spray with non-stick cooking spray and set aside."
- "In a small bowl whisk together both of the flours, the ground flaxseed, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and ginger. Set that aside."
- "Stir in the brown sugar, beaten eggs and melted butter to the milk and oats. Then add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until just combined. If using an optional add in (such as nuts or chocolate chips) then fold that in now."
- "Pour the batter into the muffin tins and place the pan into the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. You&#39;ll have a little additional batter left. I made 6 mini muffins with the remaining batter (same temperature for 8 or so minutes)."
- "Transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely. As with most baked banana goods, the flavor of these is much better and more pronounced the next day."
- "Store muffins covered at room temperature for 3-4 days."
