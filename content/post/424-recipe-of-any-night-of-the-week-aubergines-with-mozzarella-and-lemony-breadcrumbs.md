Felicity Cloake: Brighten up your bleak February evenings with a touch of stodgy Mediterranean magic. Crispy breadcrumbs, melty cheese and the soft aubergine and riceâ€¦ they&#39;re little balls of heaven. I experimented with making some slightly larger rice balls and some smaller ones, and I think the smaller ones worked better - they were neater, and held together more tightly. A weeknight twist on an Italian classic.
