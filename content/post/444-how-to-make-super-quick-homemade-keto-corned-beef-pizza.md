##### Steps to make Keto corned beef pizza:

1. Heat the coconut oil in a pan. Saute the corned beef. Add the chilli paste and the garlic paste and saute for 5 mins. Put aside.

Evenly sprinkle your spices over the beef and add any vegetables that you want to increase the flavor of the corned. A low-carb pizza crust might sound weird, but an ordinary pizza crust is guaranteed to kick you out of ketosis, and let&#39;s not forget about the restaurant-made tomato pizza sauce that typically has several grams of added sugar. Neither of these ingredients is in line with your fat-burning goals, so we&#39;ve got. When I make corned beef, I usually include salt, garlic, onions and carrots in the pot. Well, my friendly butcher told me to cook the corned beef in only water.
