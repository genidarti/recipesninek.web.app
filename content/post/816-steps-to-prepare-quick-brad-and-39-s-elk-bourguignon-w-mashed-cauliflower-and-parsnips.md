This blend of parsnip &amp; cauliflower mash does taste like it should: it has a slight sweetness from the parsnips that comes through. I think it pairs gorgeously with the garlic and chives, but although delicious, it&#39;s not quite mashed potatoes. The texture, however, is pretty damn close to mashed. Elk is very lean and also very tender when cooked slowly on low heat (or quickly on high heat).

It is very low in calories, fat and cholesterol and high in protein. Hints: I cook a batch of bacon in advance and keep in the freezer to add at the end. Browning the meat is key to the rich flavour. Mashed parsnips are made very similarly to mashed potatoes and can be substituted into any meal you would usually serve with mashed potatoes. Mashed parsnips are full of much more flavor, slightly sweet, but the same great texture.
