recipeinstructions:

- "Pat dough into rectangle again and when it&#39;s about 1/2&#34; thick, cut into circle shapes. (I used the lid ring for a small Mason jar) Spray a cookie sheet with oil and place dough rounds across the pan. When pan is full, place into hot oven for approximately 12-15 minutes."
- "Because they are gluten free, these biscuits don&#39;t brown as much as other kinds, but instead, have a light golden color at the edges."
- "While the biscuits are baking, gather ingredients for sausage gravy making."
- "Start by heating a larger pot on stovetop at medium-low heat with a Tbsp of oil. Add diced onion and garlic. Heat till softened and slightly translucent."
