- " fresh grated pecorino romano"
- " Angel hair"
- " Red pepper flakes"
- " chopped Italian parsley"

recipeinstructions:
- "Add the garlic to the cold oil and sauté at a low simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes until light golden brown, season with fresh ground black pepper mid way through."
- "Drop your angel hair into the water. Make sure your pasta water is well salted. Time this step the best you can with the next step so you don’t overcook your pasta because your not going to strain the pasta rather than use tongs or a pasta utensil to transfer it right over to your pan. When you do this make sure most of the water drains off the pasta."

- "Add the pasta and toss well"
- "Add a 1/2 cup of the pasta water and simmer until a tight sauce has formed around the noodles. Remove from the heat and sprinkle in some fresh grated Romano, or whatever grated cheese you prefer."
- "Blackened chicken-I’m not going to dictate when you cook your chicken or how. Sometimes I grill and sometimes I pan fry. Either way, I do this step first and set it at warm in the oven until I’m ready for it."
