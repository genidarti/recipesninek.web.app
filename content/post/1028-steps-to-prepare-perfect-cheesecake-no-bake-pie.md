- "1/3 cup melted butter or margarine"

recipeinstructions:
- "Make the crust first. Combine graham crackers and cookies in a food processor or gallon ziploc bag. Grind or beat them to a pulp. Add the sugar and butter and combine til itâ€™s the consistency of wet sand. Put in a pie dish and press it into place. I use the bottom of a measuring cup sprayed with nonstick spray.
