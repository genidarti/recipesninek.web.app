- "Put the beef on the grill pan. See, even after the carrot is cooked, the corn is still there to continue the process. The fat melted from the beef will make the corn taste richer."
- "By the way, besides black pepper and salt I spread butter and honey to all the corn cobs, carrot and beef. Yummy!"
