recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the cake.  Preheat oven to 175 degree celsius or 350 fahrenheit.  Grease the cake pan with butter.  Lay parchment paper at the bottom and at the sides as well.  Brush the paper with butter and dust icing sugar over the top.  Swirl to coat every nooks and cranny with the icing sugar."
- "Tap out any excess.  Set aside until ready to use.  Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and add in the white chocolate.  Mix to combine well and until the chocolate has melted.  Set aside until ready to use."
- "In a large mixing bowl, add eggs and sugar.  Using a hand mixer, whip for about 7 mins or until tripled in volume.  Stir limoncello into white chocolate mixture.  Fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.  Once the chocolate mixture has fully incorporated, fold in the flour.  Once the flour has fully incorporated, add in salt and lemon zest."
- "Give it a final fold and transfer it into the prepared cake pan.  Wack into the oven and bake for 20 to 25 mins. Do not bake longer than 25 mins.  The center should be still soft and molten.  Set aside to cool down completely."
- "While the cake is cooling down, prepare the ganache.  Adjust the temperature of the oven to 120 degrees celsius or 250 fahrenheit.  Transfer white chocolate into a heatproof bowl and wack into the oven.  Bake for 10 mins.  Remove the chocolate from the oven and fold to smoothen."
- "It will be very stiff and hard to fold at 1st. Continue folding until smoothen.*  Wack the chocolate into the oven and bake for 10 mins.  Remove from oven, fold and bake.  Continue the process until the white chocolate turns into a caramel color.  *I stopped mine at the 7th interval.*"
- "Fold in the cream in 1/3 portions.  When the cream has fully incorporated, you should get a deep dark caramel color.  Once the cake has completely cool, drizzle in the caramelized white chocolate ganache.  Swirl to level the ganache."
- "Chill in the fridge overnight.  The next day, unmold onto a serving plate or a cake stand.  Sprinkle matcha salt and pomegranate over the top.  Slice and serve.  *To make matcha salt, blitz 1 TBSP of maldon sea salt and 1 TSP of matcha until powdery in a spice grinder.*"
