recipeingredient:
- "5 Eggs"
- "3 cc Soy sauce"
- "10 cc Sweet sake"
- "3 g Salt"
- "10 g Sugar"
- "100 ml Dashi broth"
recipeinstructions:
- "Lightly mix eggs in a bowl. Mix all seasonings and add slowly mix in the bowl."
- "Grease a square frying pan. Make sure the pan is fully greased by spreading it with a paper towel. To test if the pan is warm enough, use a chopstick to put a drop of the egg mixture onto the frying pan. If the drop fries right away, it is ready."
- "Scoop the mixture to just more than half the ladle, and pour it in the frying pan. Use a chopstick to pop the bubbles, this will distribute the heat evenly. Before the omelette is too hard, roll the omelette quickly towards yourself in three-fold"
- "Use a greased paper towel to grease the now open area of the frying pan, then push the folded omelette away from yourself and grease the newly (closer to you) open area of frying pan"
- "Pour another ladle of the egg mix into the pan. Lift the previously rolled omelette in the first fold. Repeat. After the third scoop, fold in two-fold."
- "Use the hot edges of the frying pan to clean up the edges. Cool at room temperature. As it cools, any softness or space in the inner layers of the omelette will disappear and you are left with a beautiful looking omelette."
