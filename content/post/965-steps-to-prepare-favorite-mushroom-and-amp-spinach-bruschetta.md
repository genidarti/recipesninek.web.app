recipeingredient:
- "1 small loaf baguette"
- "1 clove garlic halved"
- "1 pint cremini mushrooms"
- "1/4 pound Gruyere cheese grated a generous cup"
- "1 Tbsp Sherry or Marsala"
- "pinch salt if needed"
- " fresh thyme leaves about 2 Tbsp plus more for garnish"
- " Fresh cracked black pepper"
- " Hand full of fresh spinach"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the bread in half lengthwise, so you have a large cut surface. You will not need the whole loaf, I used about a 6 inch by 6 inch piece of ciabatta. Grill the bread, cut side down, on a hot grill until it starts to get nice char marks. Rub the cut side of the garlic across the bread while it is still hot. Set aside. Dust off the mushrooms with a clean dish cloth. Trim off the tips of the stems, and then thickly slice them."
- "Heat a cast iron or saute pan on medium high, and add the mushrooms and thyme leaves. Dry saute the mushrooms, stirring often so they won&#39;t stick to the pan, until they release their moisture and are softened. This will only take a couple of minutes. Add spinach"
- "Add the sherry and let it sizzle for just a few seconds. Stir to deglaze the pan and get up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Season with a pinch of salt, if needed."
- "Spoon the mushrooms and any juice onto the bread. Top with the cheese, some black pepper, and a little more fresh thyme. Broil until the cheese is melted."
- "Notes -slice the bread into individual portions and enjoy right away."
- "Notes -Set aside a few cooked mushroom slices to garnish the bruschetta after it comes out of the broiler if you want it to look like it does in the photos."
- "Notes- use what you have or what you like. I didn’t have the sherry, the right mushrooms or the right cheese lol... and it still turned out awesome."
