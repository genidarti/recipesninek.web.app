recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cups Organic spelt flour"
- "1/2 cup Organic oat flour"
- "3 cup organic AP flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "2 tsp melted butter"
- "2 Tsp brown sugar"
- "2 cups warm water"
- "1/2 cup sourdough starter"
- "1/2 tsp dry yeast"
- "2 quarts salt  12 cup baking soda"
- " Coarse sea salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pretty much follow the steps for making regular sourdough bread. Mix all wet ingredients and then adding flour, one cup at a time. The reason I add a small amount of dry yeast is for better rising and cutting the fermentation time. If you pursue nutrition then skip yeast and increase sourdough starter to 1 cup and ferment 6 hours."
- "Allow the dough to rest and rise for 4-5 hours. Roll the dough into a long rope and cut it to 22 portions at 1 inch length. Shape it into pretzel bite size. Allow them to rest 15 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 375F. Bring the water to a boil then add baking soda. Boil the pretzels at 7-8 per batch for 30 second. Remove with a large slotted spoon and set aside. Work on the rest of pretzels until finish."
- "Spread all boiled pretzels on a baking sheet. Brush the tops with butter and sprinkle coarse salt. Bake into the oven and bake 15-18 minutes until the color turn into golden brown."
