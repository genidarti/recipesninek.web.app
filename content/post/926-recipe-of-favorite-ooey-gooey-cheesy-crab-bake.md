My longtime girl friend, Miss Kenna Jane, brought these Ooey Gooey Pecan Cheesecake Bars to a work potluck many years. Cool COMPLETELY before slicing into bars and serving. Take all of these parts and pieces, toss them together into Ooey Gooey Butter Cake Bars, and this recipe may be as good as dessert gets. I prefer to use a gooey sliced provolone, which has a pretty neutral flavor, but binds everything together in gooey, melty strands of cheese.
