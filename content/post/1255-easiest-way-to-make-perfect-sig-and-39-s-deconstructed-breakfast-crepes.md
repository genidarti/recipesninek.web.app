- " small or medium eggs"
- " I slice of black pudding"
- " smoked streaky bacon"
- " mushrooms"
- " For sauce either use maple syrup or honey"
- " Paper kitchen towel and a little olive oul"
recipeinstructions:
- "First whisk each egg separately. You will only need one egg per crepe. With paper kitchen towel over top of open olive oil bottle, tip the bottle a little, use the oil on paper to season your crepe or other flat pan. No need to spray oil or use butter. Heat the pan, when it is hot, pour the first whisked egg into pan, it should start to set immediately. Roll the set crepe up.Remove from pan, set aside. Make next crepe in the same way."
- "Wipe out the pan, slice black pudding, start crumbling it as it starts to crisp. When you are happy with consistency of crumbs and crisp remove from pan, again this happens pretty quick, set aside. Wipe out pan."
- "In same pan crisp your bacon or do this under grilling you prefer. I use the pan as there is almost no fat being used other the little bit when the crepes are made. When the bacon turns to crisp from both sides, add the sliced mushrooms so that they will soak up some of the pan flavours, remove bacon. Put bacon onto kitchen towel to soak up fat and to dry for a good crumble when eaten."
- "Arrange all on serving plate. Serve with honey or maple syrup if you like."
- "The crepes can be eaten on their own, filled or drizzled with whatever you like."
