recipeingredient:
- "1 packages 8 ounce brick cream cheese"
- "1 packages Oreo cookies"
- "12 oz Ghiardelli chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring cream cheese to room temperature for ease of mixing."
- "Place cream cheese in mixing bowl."
- "Crush a full package of Oreos (not the family size); I tried this with a mallet an made a terrific mess. My mallet was in the middle of a dish washer cycle when I made these one time and I used an apple corer/slicer. This tool worked beautifully. There was little to no mess or wasted cookie bits after use and you&#39;ll get the consistency you want."
- "TIP: you can leave chunks but the cookie balls will fall apart easy; I recommend making the cookies a fine powder/paste."
- "Place cookie pieces in the mixing bowl."
- "Mix until thoroughly incorporated and the mixture looms like a dark paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you mix to not waste any deliciousness."
- "Melt the chocolate chips in 30 second intervals using a microwave. You can use a double boiler technique as well."
- "Lay wax paper out near the mixing bowl and the bowl with chocolate to easily place the truffles."
- "Once the chocolate is melted, make small balls of the mixture, rolling them in the palms of your hands."
- "Drop the Oreo ball into the chocolate and ensure it is covered using a spoon to roll it around."
- "Drop chocolate-covered Oreo balls on prepared wax paper."
- "You will most likely have to stop midway and reheat the chocolate; you need to maintain a liquid state."
- "Continue this process until out of ingredients."
- "Chill until firmed. I used my freezer to speed the process."
- "Remelt the remaining chocolate or add more chocolate if necessary once the chocolate coating ha firmed."
- "Remove the sheet of truffles from the freezer, and drizzle melted chocolate on truffles using a fork."
