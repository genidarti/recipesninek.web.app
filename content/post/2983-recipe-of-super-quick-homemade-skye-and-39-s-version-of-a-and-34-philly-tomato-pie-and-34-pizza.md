- "now transfer the dough to a large bowl that has been brushed with oil... turn dough to coat all the way around. cover with plastic wrap and a towel and set in a warm spot for the first rise. you want it to double in size... about 2 hours."
- "punch dough down and reshape it into a ball. return it to the same bowl and cover. now put it in the refrigerator for it&#39;s second slow rise. refrigerate dough 4 - 12 hours. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP."
