- " Bosch pears 2 medium size"
- " Vegan butter unsalted"
- " Sugar can use brown cane organic"
- " Ground cinnamon"
- " Ground nutmeg"
- " Ground ginger optional"
- " Vegan wonton wraps Nasoya company makes good ones"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the pears. Peel them (optional) and dice into small cubes. In a skillet, add vegan butter (3 tbsp) and 1/2 cup of sugar. Once sugar has dissolved add the pears and cook on medium heat until tender. Set aside to cool."
- "Preheat your oven to 350f or air fryer(I used the bread function in my airfryer)"
- "Unwrap the wontons and place about six or eight of them on a baking sheet. Once pears are cool enough to the touch, add about half a spoon in the center of a wonton. Cover with another wonton (use a bit of water on the edges of the wonton to help seal them) use a fork to press into the wontons to make seams and keep the filling from falling out. I cut a slit in the middle the same you would a pie to help steam come out and not break the dough."
- "I baked them for about 10 to 12 minutes making sure to peek so they wont burn (some of them did bake a little too much) Once they cooled down, I ate them with a nice cup of hibiscus tea. Perfect little pie for kids too."
