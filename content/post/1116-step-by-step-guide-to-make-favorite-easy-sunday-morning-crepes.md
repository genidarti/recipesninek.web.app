Pour in 1/8 cup of batter (1/4 cup if using a bigger pan) and swirl around until the bottom of the pan is completely covered. Cook about 1 minute, maybe less, then check to see if the underside has turned brown. Once brown, flip it over, cook about 1/2 as long again (about 30 seconds or so)."
- "Stack crepes as they are done and keep covered with tin foil or at a very low heat in the oven to keep them warm. Serve immediately (though you can freeze them for later, if you want)."
- "The one pictured below has the caramelized apples, Greek yoghurt, lychee honey, toasted almond slivers, and a pinch of sea salt. Quite tasty, I have to say."
