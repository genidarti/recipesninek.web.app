recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup chopped onion"
- "1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper"
- "1/2 cup chopped baby portabello mushrooms just the caps"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 lb lean ground beef"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp paprika"
- "1 pinch cayenne pepper"
- "2 12oz cans refrigerated biscuits 10 count cans"
- "10 slice provolone cheese for topping we also like using pepperjack"
- "2 pouches Velveeta queso blanco cheese sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to whatever temp is noted on your biscuit cans. Grease the outer 10 wells of 2 muffin tins (since we&#39;re not using all the wells this ensures the most even cooking). Set aside."
- "Heat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add the olive oil, then all the veggies. Let the veggies sit long enough without being touched that they begin to char, this should only take about 30 seconds at med-high. Then stir and let sit again. Do this for 4-5 minutes until there are little char spots all over veggies. You are charring (not burning, there is a difference) to get that &#34;grill&#34; effect of Philly veggies. Transfer veggies to a small bowl and set aside."
- "In same skillet Brown ground beef with all the seasonings (reference ingredients attached to this step). When meat if browned drain if necessary, but do not rinse. Return to skillet along with veggies and cheese sauce. Stir until well combined."
- "Working one biscuit at a time, flatten and stretch so that the edges will reach the top of the muffin well then carefully press into well to make the bowl."
- "Fill each biscuit equally with a little bit of the meat mixture until it is all used up. You want your meat mix to fill them all the way up. When bowls are full, stack the provolone slices and cut into quarters. Place 2 quarters on top of each bowl."
- "Place muffin tins side by side in oven and bake for amount of time noted for biscuits on can. I think mine went about 13 minutes. You may want to rotate or switch the tuns half way through to encourage even baking."
- "When done, pull out of oven, let cool slightly, run a butter knife around the edges to loosen if needed, pop out and serve!"
- "Variation: For a slightly different taste and texture you can use crescent dough in place of biscuits. I use 2 cans of crescent roll sheets. Roll them out and cut into 10 squares each. Follow steps for pressing biscuits from here. Bake at time and temp on crescent dough can."
