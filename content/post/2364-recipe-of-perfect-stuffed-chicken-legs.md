recipeingredient:
- " Chicken"
- "6 boned out chicken legs"
- "24 slice thin sliced center cut bacon"
- "3 tsp olive oil"
- "1 salt and pepper"
- "2 tbsp marsala"
- "1 tsp sherry vinegar"
- "1/4 cup chicken stock"
- " stuffing"
- "1/4 cup pistachiosshelled"
- "1 egg"
- "4 sprigs of thyme leaves pulled and chopped"
- "1 pinch chopped parsley"
- "1/4 lb quality pork sausage"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the stuffing, mix the sausage meat with the pistachio nuts, egg yolk, thyme and parsley. Season well with salt and pepper."
- "Open out the chicken legs or thighs, season with pepper and divide the stuffing between them. Roll up to enclose. Lay about four bacon rashers on a board, overlapping them slightly. Put one stuffed chicken portion on top and wrap the bacon around to cover completely. Repeat with the rest of the chicken."
- "Cut six very large pieces of foil. Wrap each chicken parcel tightly in foil, twisting the ends to seal. Roll back and forth to even the shape. Poach the chicken parcels, two or three at a time, in a large pan of boiling water for 25-30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked. Allow to cool in the foil, then refrigerate for 30 minutes (this helps the bacon to &#34;set&#34; around the chicken). Remove the foil and pat dry to remove any excess moisture."
- "Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and carefully sauté the chicken parcels until the bacon is brown and crisp on all sides. Transfer to a warm platter and rest in a warm place."
- "Deglaze the pan with the sherry vinegar, then add the Marsala and stock. Let bubble to reduce by half, then skim off excess fat and check the seasoning."
- "Cut the chicken into thick slices and arrange on your plate. Pour over the Marsala mix and serve immediately. I made cheesy garlic mashed potatoes. With a blue cheese spinach apple and almond salad to go with this."
