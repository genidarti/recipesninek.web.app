I am not a huge fan of cream cheese, which I have seen in every. First, stick a sleeve of Oreos in a gallon-size resealable bag and use the back of a spoon to smash them up as small as possible so your truffles aren&#39;t lumpy. Cover up that naked truffle in a cloak of chocolate, and stick it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. If you want to get fancy, decorate the top.
