recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the egg yolks and castor sugar in a metal mixing bowl"
- "Place the mixing bowl over a saucepan with boiling water and whisk the mixture continuously using a hand-held metal whisk till it resembles a pale yellow foam (this technique is called a bain-marie, and the mixture is called a sabayon)."
- "When the sabayon is ready, take it off the bain-marie and let cool for 8 to 10 minutes."
- "While the sabayon is cooling, whip the cream and sugar together till firm. You can use an electric mixer for this."
- "Mix the sabayon into the whipped cream till well incorporated."

- "Dip the Savoiardi biscuits (only ONE long side facing down) in the espresso-liqueur for 1-2 seconds."
- "Place the biscuits in the dish with dipped side facing upwards. This way, the liquid will seep through till the bottom and soak the whole biscuit."
- "Complete one layer in the bottom of the dish using half the biscuits. You may break the biscuits to fit them into the edges, if so required."
- "Spread half the sabayon-cream-mascarpone mixture over the biscuit layer."
- "Use the remaining biscuits and coffee and make a second layer over the cream."
- "Spread the remaining sabayon-cream-mascarpone mixture over the second layer."
- "Dust the top lightly with the chocolate powder and cinnamon powder (I used drinking chocolate powder here). Use a fine sieve for this."
- "Serve into individual dessert plates. Enjoy!"
