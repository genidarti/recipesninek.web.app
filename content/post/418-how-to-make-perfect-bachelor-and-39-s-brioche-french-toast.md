recipeinstructions:

- "In a large mixing bowl: crack (1) large egg, add about equal parts milk (I eyeball it), add cinnamon to taste, and then add about a tablespoon of local honey. Whisk until the honey has dissolved into the concoction (this may take a few minutes)."
- "While the frying pan is warming on low/medium heat: dip the first slice of brioche into the concoction for about 5 seconds lifting the bread up a bit mid way through to create a sponge effect that soaks in the solution. Repeat this step for the other side of the bread, as well as subsequent pieces."
- "Once the first piece of brioche has been fully dipped and the pan is warm: add the brioche to the pan while simultaneously preparing another slice. Cooking time for (1) slice is about 8 minutes (4 minutes on each side). Repeat these steps for subsequent French toast pieces."
- "Warm syrup in the microwave and then pour on top of French toast."
- "Eat fool!"
