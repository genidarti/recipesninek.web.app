- "1 large or 2 small lemons"
- "2 each branches fresh rosemary"
- "2 each to 3 branches fresh taragon"
- "2 each fresh oregano"
- " paprika sprinkle for color"

- "1 chicken with the skin still on"
recipeinstructions:
- "All spices are to be measured to a person&#39;s personal taste. Meaning if you&#39;re not crazy over oregano,then by all means omit, or use less. I used two to three branches per fresh herb."
- "Prepare chicken leaving skin on. The chicken will not require liquid, because it will be cooking in its own fat. This makes for a very tender chicken."
- "Brush chicken with melted, or rub with softened butter on chicken skin. Break off some of the fresh herbs, and place the herbs around sides, and top of chicken. Leaving some of the herbs in tact, to place around sides, and top. I like to turn my chicken over half way through the cooking process. This is, however, not necessary Leaving the chicken alone is fine."
- "Cook 8-10 hours on low. Remove chicken from crockpot, set aside and begin gravy. (See lemon pepper recipe) Remove skin from the chicken,  carve chicken, set aside. I personally place the chicken back into the liquid to keep it from drying while I separate the bones, and skin from the meat. (Do not discard skin, and bones.) It has been proven that animal fat is essential for brain health.  Once separated, remove chicken (if it was placed back in the crock) with a slotted spoon to drain liquid off the chicken."
- "Reserve skin, and bones to place back in liquid after all edible chicken has been removed. Use 5-6 cups of water to pour into remaining liquid, bones, and chicken skin. Cook on low overnight to make a full bodied chicken broth. Strain broth the next morning, and discard leftover fat, bones. I freeze my broth in ice cube trays, and use as needed. Enjoy!"
