- "TO MAKE THE PESTO: In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the chopped kale, avocado chunks, chopped garlic, walnuts, salt, lemon juice and green chili."
- "Drizzle olive oil through the open chute on top and blitz until fully combined, scraping the sides of the processor in between. Do a taste test and add lemon juice, salt or oil if needed. Make a slightly coarse paste."

- "Notes  Leftover pesto sauce can be stored in an airtight glass jar for up to 3 to 4 days. To store for a longer time, drizzle some oil over the pesto sauce to prevent the top from browning.  Pestos are not only for pastas; you can use them up in sandwiches, as dips, on pizzas (instead of tomato sauce), in salads etc.  Use any kind of pasta you love; it could be spaghetti, macaroni, spiral, rigatone, shell etc.  Instead of walnuts, you can use cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds etc."
- "For best results and taste, use EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) but if you cannot find it, regular refined oil will do.  If you love cheese, stir in 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese while making the pesto and serve with a sprinkle of more Parmesan!"
