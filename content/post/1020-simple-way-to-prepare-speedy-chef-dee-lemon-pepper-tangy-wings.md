recipeinstructions:

When I made this I added a little bit of each at a time until it tasted the way I liked it. The lemon should overpower the buttery flavor, If it tastes to lemony, add more butter."
- "When the wings are done, drain them and then put them in the bowl with the sauce. with a large spoon, stir them until the sauce coats all the wings."
- "Extra after the final toss in seasoning and butter you can dust the wings with a light lemon pepper dust and serve"
