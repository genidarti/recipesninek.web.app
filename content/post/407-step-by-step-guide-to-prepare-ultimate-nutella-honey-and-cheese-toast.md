When I introduced this nostalgic treat to my children several years ago (before I was as health conscience as I am today and before researching the ingredients) they loved it almost as much as my Italian husband; so I was sad that it&#39;s not a treat they could enjoy. A sweet grilled cheese made with goat cheese, nutella and french toast bread! Most of them, except one: cheese and &#34;Nocilla&#34; (Spain&#39;s version of Nutella), on toast. As strange as it sounds, probably one of the yummiest things we&#39;ve ever tasted.
