recipeinstructions:
- "First, cut each Chicken Brest in half and marinate in Buffalo Sauce, Horseradish Sauce, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Lemon Juice, and Lime Juice. Place the Chicken in the fridge for 20-30 minutes to marinate. *You can vary the amount of spiciness by adjusting the amount of Buffalo Sauce and Horseradish Sauce. * I went for more of a milder medium, because my friends are weenies... JK. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‰"
- "In the meantime, you can mince the onion."
- "After the chicken is done marinating, heat a pot on the stove, pour in some olive oil. Place chicken, excess marinade, tiny minced onion, cup of stock or broth, and the butter. Cover the pot, turn heat to medium/low(a 2 setting). Cover the pot and let simmer for one hour. If the chicken starts to dry out, you can add more stock or broth. *This is my version of fast-slow cooking, you could also make pulled chicken in the crockpot if you have more time."
- "After the hour, take two forks and shred/pull your chicken. You can add more Buffalo Sauce, if you need more spice. *You can also make your own Buffalo Sauce by taking any kind of hot sauce and melting butter with it. The more butter, the milder the sauce."
- "Now that you have your pulled chicken, you need to assemble the nachos. Place the tortilla chips on a a large try or baking pan. Spread pulled chicken, lettuce, corn/corn salad, then shredded cheese evenly over the tortilla chips. * Use condiments such as: sour cream, salsa, cilantro, jalapenos, and extra hot sauce. Blue cheese crumbles would also be nice if you have any of those around! Mmmmmm..."
- "I used Corn Salad on my nachos. The corn salad is not my recipie, I found it online. It is made with chili powder, lime juice, cilantro, and mayo. The dish is made by Michelle at adailydishoflife.com. The recipie is called Mexican Corn Salad. Very easy and tasty.ðŸŒ½"
