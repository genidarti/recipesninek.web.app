recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the cake.   Preheat oven to 190 degrees celsius or 375 fahrenheit.  Lightly grease baking sheet or loaf pan with butter.  *If you are serving tiramisu in jars, use baking sheet, otherwise, use a loaf pan.*"
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peak forms with a hand or stand mixer.  While still whisking, gradually add in the sugar.  Keep whisking until stiff peak forms. It should be glossy and almost double in volume."
- "Add in egg yolks gradually while continue whisking.  Sieve in the almond flour and gently fold with a spatula until well combined.  *Do not overmix.*"
- "Transfer the batter onto the prepared baking sheet or loaf pan.  Wack into the oven and bake for about 20 mins or until it pass the skewer test.  Remove from oven and immediately unmold onto wire cooling rack.  Set aside to cool completely, preferably overnight."
- "Prepare the fillings.   Prepare a double boiler.  Add egg yolks onto the double boiler.  Whisk constantly until pale yellowish."
- "Remove from heat and add in the icing sugar.  Return back to the heat.  Whisk until well combined and the sugar has dissolved.  Remove from heat.  Add in the mascarpone and mix until well combined."
- "Add in the cream gradually while still whisking.  Continue whisking until the cream is fully incorporated.  In a mixing bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar."
- "Using a hand or stand mixer, whisk until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the egg whites mixture into the egg yolk mixture in 1/3 portions.  Continue folding until the egg whites have fully incorporated.  Cover with cling film, making sure the cling film is in contact with the mascarpone filling."
- "Set aside in the fridge to chill, preferably overnight.  On tiramisu assembly day, add Grand Marnier into the mascarpone filling.  Lightly whisk the mixture until fluffy.  *Do not overmix or it will separate.*"
- "Keep chill in the fridge until ready to use.  Prepare the coffee syrup.  Add espresso, orange zest and Grand Marnier in a small bowl.  Stir to combine well.  Keep chill in the fridge until ready to use."
- "Assemble the tiramisu.  If you are serving the tiramisu in jars, these are the layering processes:  Using a cookie cutter, slightly smaller than the circumference of the jar, cut out discs from the sheet cake.  Lay the 1st layer of cake into the jar.  Add some crumbs to cover any excess space."
- "Drizzle in some coffee syrup.  Sprinkle in some chocolate chips.  Dust some cocoa powder over the top.  Spoon the mascarpone filling over the cocoa powder."
- "Place another layer of sheet cake onto the filling.  Add some crumbs to cover any excess space.  Drizzle in some coffee syrup.  Spread marmalade over the cake."
- "Spoon the mascarpone filling over the top.  At this point, you should reach the brim of the jar.  Dust cocoa powder over the top and garnish with orange zest."
- "Repeat the steps for the remaining jars.  Cover and set aside chilled in the fridge, preferably overnight.  It will taste better the next day."
- "If you are serving the tiramisu the way it should be, these are the processes:  Using a sharp knife, slowly slice the sponge cake lengthwise into 3 equally thick slices.  Line cling film over the loaf pan.  Spread 1/3 portion of the mascarpone filling into the loaf pan."
- "Stack the one of the cake slices on top of the filling.  Generously brush the sponge cake with the coffee syrup.  Spread another 1/3 portion of the mascarpone filling on top of the cake slice.  Distribute chocolate chips evenly over the top."
- "Dust cocoa powder over the top.  Next, stack another slice of cake over the top.  Brush the cake with the coffee syrup.  Spread marmalade on top of the cake."
- "Spread the remaining portion of the mascarpone filling over the top.  Lightly dust cocoa powder over the top.  Stack the remaining slice of sponge cake."
- "Lastly, brush the cake with coffee syrup.  Wrap the loaf pan with cling film.  Set aside chilled in the fridge, preferably overnight.  It will taste better the next day."
- "If you are serving in jars, you can straight away enjoy the tiramisu from the jar.  Otherwise, carefully and swiftly, flip the loaf pan onto a cake stand or a serving plate and unwrap the cling film.  Dust with more cocoa powder.  Garnish with orange zest.  Slice and serve immediately."
