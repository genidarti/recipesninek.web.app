- "Fold the flour and sugar mix into the meringue in four goes, using a spatula or a hand whisk – be careful not to deflate the mix."
- "Pour it into the tin, cut a spatula through the batter to smooth it out and remove any air pockets."
- "Bake for 40-45 minutes until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean and the sponge springs back when gently pressed."
- "Immediately invert the tin and prop it up on an upturned bowl or small pot, so the cake is suspended in the tin. Leave it to cool completely."
- "When cold, run a palette knife around the sides of the tin to release the cake, then run it along the bottom and around the tube to unmould it. Place on a serving dish and decorate with strawberries, cream, and all things summery."
