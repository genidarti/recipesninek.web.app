recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Once it&#39;s hot, add the beef and cook, breaking it up, until it&#39;s browned throughout. Then drain any excess grease and add the onion to the skillet. Once the onion softens up, add the garlic and cook another minute or so, until fragrant.

Place the shredded mozzarella, parmesan and white cheddar in a bowl and toss together to integrate it all together."
- "Place half of the pasta into the prepared pan, then top with half of the ricotta and half of the meat sauce. Sprinkle half of the shredded cheese blend over that, then repeat the layers with the rest. Make sure to completely cover the pasta with the top layer of sauce. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Then remove the foil, and bake another 15-20 minutes, until the cheese has started to brown. Let it cool for 10 or so minutes, then slice into squares and serve."
