- "400 ml milk"
- "80 g flour"
- "400 g butter"
- "320 g sugar"
- "40 g hazelnuts chopped"
- " dough"
- "120 g butter"
- "300 g sugar"
- "2 eggs"

recipeinstructions:
- "First you have to make the frosting. 1. Mix the milk with the flour together in a small saucepan with a whisk and heat over medium heat and stirring. After a few minutes the mixture will thicken and become thicker and thicker until it reaches the consistency of a thick pudding."
- "2. Remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool completely at room temperature. To stir it from time to time, then it goes a little faster. Overall, the cooling takes about 1 hour."
- "3. In the meantime stir the soft butter in a mixing bowl until creamy. Then add the sugar and mix together lightly and cream until only a few sugar crumbs are felt when rubbing the mixture between two fingers. This takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the mixer. In between, always free the sides of the bowl with a silicone scraper. It&#39;s ok if not all sugar crumbs have disappeared, as they should resolve next step."
- "4. Add the fully-cooled flour-milk mixture to the butter-sugar mixture and whisk for about 5 minutes. Now the frosting is basically done. To make sure that the consistency for sprinkling cupcakes is a little firmer, you should use the frosting for a few minutes"
- "5. While cooling the frosting, bake the cupcakes. Preheat the oven to 180 ° C top / bottom heat or 160 C convection and lay out a 12 mm muffin tray with paper cups."
- "6. Beat the soft butter with the sugar and the egg lightly and lightly for 1-2 minutes. Add the salt, flour, cocoa and baking powder and stir briefly. Finally, slowly stir in the milk until a smooth dough has formed."
- "7. Evenly fill the dough into the prepared paper cups (for the amount of this recipe, a 24-piece ice cream scoop is very good and put a chocolate bonnet on the middle of each cupcake, but do not press it.) Bake the cupcakes in the oven for about 18 minutes."
- "8. Take the cupcakes out and take them out of the baking pan after about 2 minutes and allow to cool completely on a grill."
- "9. Once the frosting is complete, stir in the chopped hazelnuts and then spray the frosting onto the fully cooled cupcakes. To get the same look as on my photos a big hole grommet (mine comes from this set and has an opening of 13mm) use. Hold the piping bag centered over the cupcake at a 90-degree angle and press out frosting with even pressure until the resulting ball has reached the desired size."
- "10. Sprinkle the last 20 g of chopped hazelnuts on the cupcakes, cut the chocolate buns diagonally and place 2 pieces each on a cupcake."
- "11. Enjoy your meal.❤"
