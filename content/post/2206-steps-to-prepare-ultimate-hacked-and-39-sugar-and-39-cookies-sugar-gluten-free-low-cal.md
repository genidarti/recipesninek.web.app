- "1/4 cup yogurt 35 cals"
- "6 Tablespoons erythitholtrulia effectively 0 cals  to taste"
- "3 Tablespoons egg whites 25 cals"

- "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/8 teaspoon salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre heat oven to 375. Use a tablespoon to pluck down each cookie, spread them out about an inch and half so apart. Press them down a little as well. However be gentle, they will be very light and will indeed swell a bit when baked."
- "Bake for about 15 minutes (cookies should generally start to get some browning on top not just edges.)"
- "Open the oven and turn it off, let the oven cool off with the cookies inside. Leave them like this for about 10 minutes."
- "Pull them out and let them cool. Coconut flour is finicky about drying out, this extra drying step should allow them to solidify a bit more (and weirdly increase density)."
