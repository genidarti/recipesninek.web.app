I cooked it the time suggested, didn&#39;t want it. Perfectly-spiced, incredibly moist carrot cake sandwiched around a rich layer of vanilla cheesecake and then frosted with a whipped cream cheese icing. I first published this cheesecake/carrot cake recipe a few years ago, but I re-share it every year around Easter (because, just look at it!). This carrot cake cheesecake is supposedly a knock off of the Cheesecake Factory version. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true but I do know that it&#39;s really good.
