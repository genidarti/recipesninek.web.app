recipeinstructions:
- "Mix together all the ingredients in a medium bowl with a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon."
- "The dough will be very sticky. To make it easier to work with, cover it and place it in the fridge to chill for 20 or so minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and set aside."
- "Roll dough into balls, about 1 tbsp. of dough per ball, and set onto prepared baking sheet."
- "Use a fork to flatten them down. We like to do a criss cross pattern. They won&#39;t really spread much in the oven, so it&#39;s okay to have them close together."
- "Bake for 9-10 minutes. They will still look a bit underbaked, but once cooled will yield a soft, chewy cookie. For a crispy cookie, bake an additional 2-3 minutes. Allow to cool on the pan for 3 minutes, then move them onto a wire rack to cool completely."
- "Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature."
