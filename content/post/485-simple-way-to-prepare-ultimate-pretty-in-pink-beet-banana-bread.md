It tastes just like zucchini bread to me, but it&#39;s a pretty pink color because of the beets. Beeturia, pink pee after beet consumption, is totally harmless—you&#39;re just peeing out some of the pigment. But it can be used to remind us of an important fact. Another symptom from beets - Migraine City! Lasts the whole time from when they are eaten until they make their pretty in pink exit.
