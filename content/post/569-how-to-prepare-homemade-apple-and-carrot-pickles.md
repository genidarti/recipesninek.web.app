Written by Marisa of Food in Jars. In the past week, I&#39;ve cooked and baked my way through at least five pounds of butter. There&#39;s been toffee, cookies, biscuits, yeasted breakfast breads, apple crisps, and a turkey dinner with half a dozen sides. These pickled carrots are just as easy as homemade dill pickles.

All you need to do is make a brine (water + spices + sugar + salt), heat it up, and pour it over your veggies. The longer you wait, the more flavorful your pickles will. We love these crispy tangy carrots and find ourselves. Carrot, apple, and raisins are a great combination in form of a sandwich, which is easy to make and healthy to eat. Grate one carrot and add chopped raisins, fennel powder, grated apple, mayonnaise, salt, and mix it.
